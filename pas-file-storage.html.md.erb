title: Configuring File Storage for PAS
owner: Releng
---

This topic provides instructions for configure file storage for PAS based on your IaaS and installation method. See the section that applies to your use case. 

To minimize system downtime, Pivotal recommends using highly resilient and redundant _external_ filestores for your Pivotal Application Service (PAS) file storage. For more factors to consider when selecting file storage, see the [Considerations for Selecting File Storage in Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../upgrading/configuring.html#file-storage) topic.

## <a id="internal"></a> Internal File Storage

## <a id="aws"></a> AWS

This section describes how to configure file storage for AWS. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you followed the instructions in <a href="../om/aws/prepare-env-manual.html">Installing PCF on AWS Manually</a>, you created the necessary resources for <a href="#external_s3">external S3-compatible file storage</a>.</p>

For production-level PCF deployments on AWS, Pivotal recommends selecting the **External S3-Compatible File Store**. For more information about production-level PCF deployments on AWS, see the [Reference Architecture for Pivotal Cloud Foundry on AWS](../refarch/aws/aws_ref_arch.html).

## <a id="azure"></a> Azure

This section describes how to configure file storage for Azure. 

For production-level PCF deployments on Azure, the recommended selection is Azure Storage. For more information about production-level PCF deployments on Azure, see the [Reference Architecture for Pivotal Cloud Foundry on Azure](../refarch/azure/azure_ref_arch.html).

## <a id="gcp"></a> GCP 

This section describes how to configure file storage for GCP. Follow the instructions that correspond to your installation method: [Manual](#gcp-manual) or [Terraform](#gcp-terraform). 

For production-level PCF deployments on GCP, Pivotal recommends selecting **External Google Cloud Storage**. For more information about production-level PCF deployments on GCP, see the [Reference Architecture for Pivotal Cloud Foundry on GCP](../refarch/gcp/gcp_ref_arch.html).

### <a id="gcp-manual"></a> Manual 

This section describes how to configure file storage for GCP if you installed PCF manually. 

PAS can use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as its external filestore by using either a GCP interoperable storage access key or your GCS Service Account. Choose the procedure that corresponds to your use case. 

<%= partial 'filestore_gcp_config' %>

### <a id="gcp-terraform"></a> Terraform

This section describes how to configure file storage for GCP if you installed PCF with Terraform. 

PAS can use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as its external filestore by using either a GCP interoperable storage access key or your GCS Service Account. 
Choose the procedure that corresponds to your use case. 

<%= partial 'filestore_gcp_config_terraform' %>

## <a id="openstack"></a> Openstack

For production-level PCF deployments on OpenStack, the recommended selection is **External S3-Compatible**.
