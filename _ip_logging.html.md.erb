Configure **Logging of client IPs in Router**. The **Log client IPs** option is set by default. To comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), select one of the following options to disable logging of client IP addresses:
  	* If your load balancer exposes its own source IP address, select **Disable logging of X-Forwarded-For header only**.
  	* If your load balancer exposes the source IP of the originating client, select **Disable logging of both source IP and X-Forwarded-For header**.
