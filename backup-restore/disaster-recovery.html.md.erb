This topic provides an overview of the options and considerations for disaster recovery in <%= vars.product_name_full %> (<%= vars.product_name %>).

Operators have a range of approaches for ensuring they can recover <%= vars.product_name %>, apps, and data in case of a disaster. The approaches fall into the following two categories:

* Using data from a backup to restore the data in the <%= vars.product_name %> deployment. For more information, see [Back Up and Restore Using BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR)](#bbr).

* Re-creating the data in <%= vars.product_name %> by automating the creation of state in <%= vars.product_name %>. For more information, see [Disaster Recovery by Recreating the Deployment](#recreation).


## <a id="bbr"></a> Back Up and Restore Using BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR)

### <a id="what-is-bbr"></a> What is BBR?

BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) is a CLI for orchestrating backing up and restoring BOSH deployments and BOSH Directors. BBR triggers the backup or restore process on the deployment or BOSH Director, and transfers the backup artifact to and from the deployment or BOSH Director.

Use BBR to reliably create backups of core <%= vars.product_name %> components and their data. These core components include CredHub, UAA, BOSH Director, and <%= vars.product_runtime %> (<%= vars.product_short %>).

Each component includes its own backup scripts. This decentralized structure helps keep scripts synchronized with the components. At the same time, _locking_ features ensure data integrity and consistent, distributed backups across your deployment.

For more information about the BBR framework, see [BOSH Backup and Restore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/index.html) in the open-source Cloud Foundry documentation.

### <a id="bbr-backup"></a> Backing Up <%= vars.product_name %>

Backing up <%= vars.product_name %> requires backing up the following components:

* <%= vars.ops_manager %> settings
* BOSH Director, including CredHub and UAA
* <%= vars.product_short %>
* Data services

For more information, see [Backing Up <%= vars.product_name %> with BBR](backup-pcf-bbr.html). With these backup artifacts, operators can re-create <%= vars.product_short %> exactly as it was when the backup was taken.

### <a id="bbr-restore"></a> Restoring <%= vars.product_name %>

The restore process involves creating a new <%= vars.product_name %> deployment starting with the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM. For more information, see [Restoring <%= vars.product_name %> from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html).

The time required to restore the data is proportionate to the size of the data because the restore process includes copying data. For example, restoring a 1&nbsp;TB blobstore takes one thousand times as long as restoring a 1&nbsp;GB blobstore.

### <a id="benefits"></a> Benefits

Unlike other backup solutions, using BBR to back up <%= vars.product_name %> enables:

* **Completeness:** BBR supports backing up BOSH, including releases, CredHub, UAA, and service instances created with an on-demand service broker. With <%= vars.product_name %> v1.12, <%= vars.ops_manager %> export no longer includes releases.

* **Consistency:** BBR provides referential integrity between the database and the blobstore because a lock is held while both the database and blobstore are backed up.

* **Correctness:** Using the BBR restore flow addresses container-to-container networking and routing issues that can occur during restore.

### <a id="api-downtime"></a> API Downtime During Backups

Apps are not affected during backups, but certain APIs are unavailable. The downtime occurs only while the backup is being taken, not while the backup is being copied to the jumpbox.

In a consistent backup, the blobs in the blobstore match the blobs in the Cloud Controller database. To take a consistent backup, changes to the data are prevented during the backup. This means that the Cloud Foundry API (CAPI), Routing API, Usage service, Autoscaler, Notification Service, Network Policy Server, and CredHub are unavailable while the backup is being taken. UAA is in read-only mode during the backup.

### <a id="backup-timings"></a> Backup Timings

The first three phases of the backup are lock, backup, and unlock. During this time, the API is unavailable. The drain and checksum phase starts after the backup scripts finish. BBR downloads the backup artifacts from the instances to the BBR VM, and performs a checksum to ensure the artifacts are not corrupt. The size of the blobstore significantly influences backup time.

The table below gives an indication of the downtime that you can expect. Actual downtime varies based on hardware and <%= vars.product_name %> configuration. These example timings were recorded with <%= vars.product_short %> deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with all components scaled to one and only one app pushed.

#### <a id="blobstore-bbr"></a> Blobstore Backup and Restore

Blobstores can be very large. To minimize downtime, BBR only takes blob metadata during the backup. For example, in the case of internal blobstores (Webdav/NFS), BBR takes a list of hard links that point to the blobs. Once the API becomes available, BBR makes copies of the blobs.

### <a id="not-supported"></a> Unsupported Products

* **Data services:** The Pivotal data services listed below do not support BBR. Operators of these services should use the automatic backups feature of each tile, available within <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
  * MySQL for <%= vars.product_name %>
  * RabbitMQ for <%= vars.product_name %>
  * Redis for <%= vars.product_name %>

* **External blobstores and databases:** BBR support for backing up and restoring external databases and blobstores varies across <%= vars.product_name %> versions. For more information, see [Supported Components](backup-pcf-bbr.html#supported) and [External Storage Support Across <%= vars.product_name %> Versions](backup-pcf-bbr.html#version-compatibility) in _Backing Up <%= vars.product_name %> with BBR_.

### <a id="best-practices"></a> Best Practices

This section describes best practices for backing up your <%= vars.product_name %> deployment.

#### <a id="backup-frequency"></a> Frequency of Backups

<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you take backups in proportion to the rate of change of the data in <%= vars.product_name %> to minimize the number of changes lost if a restore is required. <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends starting with backing up every 24 hours. If app developers make frequent changes, you should increase the frequency of backups.

#### <a id="artifact-retention"></a> Retention of Backup Artifacts

Operators should retain backup artifacts based on the timeframe they need to be able to restore to. For example, if backups are taken every 24 hours and <%= vars.product_name %> must be able to be restored to three days prior, three sets of backup artifacts should be retained.

Artifacts should be stored in two data centers other than the <%= vars.product_name %> data center. When deciding the restore timeframe, you should take other factors such as compliance and audit-ability into account.

#### <a id="security"></a>Security

<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you encrypt artifacts and store them securely.

## <a id="recreation"></a> Disaster Recovery by Recreating the Deployment

An alternative strategy for recovering PCF after a disaster is to have automation in place so that all the data can be recreated. This requires that every modification to PCF settings and state be automated, typically through use of a pipeline.

An alternative strategy for recovering <%= vars.product_name %> after a disaster is to have automation in place so that all the data can be re-created. This requires that every modification to <%= vars.product_name %> settings and state is automated, typically through the use of a pipeline.

Recovery steps include creating a new <%= vars.product_name %>, re-creating orgs, spaces, users, services, service bindings and other state, and re-pushing apps.

For more information about this approach, see the Cloud Foundry Summit presentation [Multi-DC Cloud Foundry: What, Why and How?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t61r8THmtsc) on YouTube.

## <a id="different-topologies"></a> Disaster Recovery for Different Topologies

This section describes disaster recovery strategies for different <%= vars.product_name %> deployment topologies.

### <a id="active-active"></a> Active-Active

To prevent app downtime, some Pivotal customers run an active-active deployment, where they run two or more identical <%= vars.product_name %> deployments in different data centers. If one <%= vars.product_name %> deployment becomes unavailable, traffic is seamlessly routed to the other deployment. To achieve identical deployments, all operations to <%= vars.product_name %> are automated so they can be applied to both <%= vars.product_name %> deployments in parallel.

Because all operations have been automated, the automation approach to disaster recovery is a viable option for an active-active deployment. Disaster recovery requires re-creating <%= vars.product_name %>, then running all the automation to re-create state.

This option requires discipline to automate all changes to <%= vars.product_name %>. Some of the operations that need to be automated are:

* App push, re-stage, scale
* Org, space, and user create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)
* Service instance CRUD
* Service bindings CRUD
* Routes CRUD
* Security groups CRUD
* Quota CRUD

Human-initiated changes always make their way into the system. These changes can include quotas being raised, new settings being enabled, and incident responses. For this reason, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends taking backups even when using an automated disaster recovery strategy.

### <a id="active-passive"></a> Active-Passive

Instead of having a true active-active deployment across all layers, some Pivotal customers prefer to install a <%= vars.product_name %> or <%= vars.product_short %> deployment on a backup site. The backup site resides on-premises, in a co-location facility, or the public cloud. The backup site includes an operational deployment, with only the most critical apps ready to accept traffic should a failure occur in the primary data center. Disaster recovery in this scenario involves:

1. Switching traffic to the passive <%= vars.product_name %>, making it active.

1. Recovering the formerly-active <%= vars.product_name %>. Operators can choose to do this through automation, if that option is available, or by using BBR and the restore process.

The RTO and RPO for re-creating the active <%= vars.product_name %> are the same as outlined in the table above.

The RTO and RPO for recreating the active PCF are the same as outlined in the table above.

## <a id="reducing-rto"></a> Reducing RTO

<<<<<<< HEAD
Both the restore and recreate data disaster recovery options require standing up a new PCF, which can take hours. If you require shorter RTO, several options involving a pre-created standby hardware and PCF are available:

There is a trade-off between cost and RTO: the less the replacement PCF needs to be deployed and scaled, the faster the restore.

## <a id="automating-backups"></a> Automating Backups

BBR generates the backup artifacts required for PCF, but does not handle scheduling, artifact management, or encryption. The BBR team has created a [starter Concourse pipeline](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bbr-pcf-pipeline-tasks) to automate backups with BBR.

Also, Stark & Wayne's Shield can be used as a front end management tool using the BBR plugin.

## <a id="validating-backups"></a> Validating Backups

To ensure that backup artifacts are valid, the BBR tool creates checksums of the generated backup artifacts, and ensures that the checksums match the artifacts on the jumpbox.

However, the only way to be sure that the backup artifact can be used to successfully recreate PCF is to test it in the restore process. This is a cumbersome, dangerous process so should be done with care. For instructions, see [Step 11: (Optional) Validate Your Backup](./backup-pcf-bbr.html#validate-backup) of the _Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR_.
