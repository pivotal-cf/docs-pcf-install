Setting appropriate ASGs is critical for a secure deployment. To acknowledge that once the PAS deployment completes, it is your responsibility to set the appropriate ASGs:

1. Select **Application Security Groups**.

1. In the **Type "X" to acknowledge this requirement** field, enter `X`.

1. Click **Save**.

For more information about ASGs, see [App Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html). For more information about setting ASGs, see [Restricting App Access to Internal PAS Components](../opsguide/app-sec-groups.html).
