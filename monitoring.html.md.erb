<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to check current VM status in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Ops Manager and how to use the vSphere client to perform ongoing monitoring and alerting of PCF VMs.

For a complete guide to monitoring PCF, see [Monitoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../monitoring/index.html).

  <td><strong>Job</strong></td><td>Each job represents a component running on one or more VMs that Ops Manager deployed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Index</strong></td><td>For jobs that run across multiple VMs, the <strong>index</strong> value indicates the order in which the job VMs were deployed. For jobs that run on only one VM, the VM has an <strong>index</strong> value of <code>0</code>.</td>

### <a id="ops-manager"></a>Operations Manager VM Disk Space ###

The Ops Manager stores its logs on the Ops Manager VM in the `/tmp` directory.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The logs collect over time and do not self-delete. To prevent the VM from running out of disk space, restart the VM to clear the
log entries from <code>/tmp</code>.</p>

## <a id="vsphere"></a>Monitoring in vSphere ##

To monitor VMs using the vSphere client:

1. Connect to a vCenter Server instance using the vSphere client.
1. Navigate to the **Hosts And Clusters** or **VMs And Templates** inventory view.
1. In the inventory tree, select a virtual machine.
1. Select the **Performance** tab from the content pane on the right.

VMware vSphere Server provides alarms that monitor VMs, as well as clusters,
hosts, datacenters, datastores, networks, and licensing.
To view preconfigured alarms, including disk usage alarms, related to a
particular VM:

1. In the vSphere client, select the VM you want to monitor.
1. At the bottom left of the client window, click **Alarms**.
1. If a VM starts to run out of disk space, an alarm appears in the bottom
panel.
