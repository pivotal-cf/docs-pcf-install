This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on OpenStack. 

## <a id='versions'></a>Supported Versions ##

Pivotal's automated testing environments have been built using OpenStack releases and distributions based on the list below from different vendors including Canonical, EMC, Mirantis, Rackspace, Red Hat, and SUSE: 

* Havana
* Icehouse
* Juno
* Kilo (Keystone v2 and v3)
* Liberty
* Mitaka
* Newton

The nature of OpenStack as a collection of interoperable components requires OpenStack expertise to troubleshoot issues that may occur when installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on particular releases and distributions.

## <a id='prereq'></a>Prerequisites ##

The following sections describe general requirements for running PCF and specific requirements for running PCF on OpenStack.

<%= partial 'requirements' %>

### <a id="openstack"></a>OpenStack Requirements ##

To deploy Pivotal Cloud Foundry on OpenStack, you must have a dedicated OpenStack tenant (formerly known as an OpenStack project) that meets the following requirements.

* You must have keystone credentials for the OpenStack tenant, including the following:

  * Auth URL
  * API key
  * Username
  * Project name
  * Region

* SSL certificate for your wildcard domain (see below)

* All necessary OpenStack network objects

* The following must be enabled for the tenant:

  * The ability to upload custom images to [Glance](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/glance/)
  * The ability to create and modify VM flavors. See the [VM flavor configuration table](#vm-flavors)
  * DHCP
  * The ability to allocate floating IPs
  * The ability for VMs inside a tenant to send messages via the floating IP.
  * Permissions for VMs to boot directly from image
  * One wildcard DNS domain. Pivotal recommends using two wildcard domains if system and apps need to be separated.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For information about how IaaS user roles are configured, refer to the <a href="iaas-user-roles.html">Pivotal Cloud Foundry IaaS User Role Guidelines</a> topic.</p>

    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: It is possible to avoid using wildcard DNS domains by using a service such as xip.io. However, this option requires granting external internet access from inside VMs.</p>

* Your OpenStack tenant must have the following resources before you install Pivotal Cloud Foundry:

  * 118 GB of RAM
  * 22 available instances
  * 16 small VMs (1 vCPU, 1024 MB of RAM, 10 GB of root disk)
  * 3 large VMs (4 vCPU, 16384 MB of RAM, 10 GB of root disk)
  * 3 extra-large VMs (8 vCPU, 16 GB of RAM, 160 GB of ephemeral disk)
  * 56 vCPUs
  * 1 TB of storage
  * Neutron networking with floating IP support

  <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using IPsec, your resource usage will increase by approximately 36 bytes. View the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html"> Installing IPsec topic</a> for information, including setting correct MTU values.</p>

* Requirements for your Cinder back end:

  * PCF requires RAW root disk images. The Cinder back end for your OpenStack tenant must support RAW.
  * Pivotal recommends that you use a Cinder back end that supports snapshots. This is required for some BOSH functionalities.
  * Pivotal recommends enabling your Cinder back end to delete block storage asynchronously. If this is not possible, it must be able to delete multiple 20GB volumes within 300 seconds.

* Using an Overlay Network with VXLAN or GRE Protocols:

  * If an overlay network is being used with VXLAN or GRE protocols, the MTU of the created VMs must be adjusted to the best practices recommended by the plugin vendor (if any).
  * DHCP must be enabled in the internal network for the MTU to be assigned to the VMs automatically.
  * Review the [Installing Elastic Runtime on OpenStack](../customizing/openstack-er-config.html#networking) topic to adjust your MTU values.
  * Failure to configure your overlay network correctly could cause Apps Manager to fail since applications will not be able to connect to the UAA.

* Miscellaneous

  * Pivotal recommends granting complete access to the OpenStack logs to the operator managing the installation process.
  * Your OpenStack environment should be thoroughly tested and considered stable before deploying PCF.
