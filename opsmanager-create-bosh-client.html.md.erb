title: Creating UAA Clients for BOSH Director
owners: Ops Manager

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the process of creating a UAA client for the BOSH Director. You must create an automation client to run BOSH from a script or set up a continuous integration pipeline.

## Local Authentication

To perform this procedure, the UAAC client must be installed on the Ops Manager virtual machine (VM). 

1. Open a terminal and SSH into the Ops Manager VM. Provide your SSH key, or when prompted, enter the password you configured for SSH access during Ops Manager deployment.
  <pre class='terminal'>
    $ ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN
    Password: ***********
  </pre>

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard** and select the **Ops Manager Director** tile. In Ops Manager Director, click the **Status** tab, and copy the **Ops Manager Director** IP address. 

1. Using the `uaac target` command, target Ops Manager Director UAA on port `8443` using the IP address you copied, and specify the location of the root certificate. The default location is `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate`.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ uaac target https://OPS-DIRECTOR-IP:8443 --ca-cert \
    /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate

    Target: http<span>s</span>://10.85.16.4:8443
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also curl or point your browser to the following endpoint to obtain the root certificate: <code>https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/security/root_ca_certificate</code></p>

1. Log in to the Ops Manager Director UAA and retrieve the owner token. Perform the following step to obtain the values for `UAA-LOGIN-CLIENT-PASSWORD` and `UAA-ADMIN-CLIENT-PASSWORD`:
       * Select the **Ops Manager Director** tile from the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**. 
       * Click the **Credentials** tab, and locate the entries for **Uaa Login Client Credentials** and **Uaa Admin User Credentials**. 
       * For each entry, click **Link to Credential** to obtain the password. 

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ uaac token owner get login -s UAA-LOGIN-CLIENT-PASSWORD
    User name:  admin
  	Password:  UAA-ADMIN-CLIENT-PASSWORD

  	Successfully fetched token via owner password grant.
  	Target: http<span>s</span>://10.85.16.4:8443
  	Context: admin, from client login
    </pre>
    
     
    <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To obtain the password for the UAA login and admin clients, you can also curl or point your browser to the following endpoints: <code>https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/uaa_login_client_credentials</code>
    and <code>https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/uaa_admin_user_credentials</code>
    </div>

1. Create a new UAA Client with `bosh.admin` privileges.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ uaac client add ci --authorized_grant_types client_credentials \
    --authorities bosh.admin --secret CI-SECRET

    scope: uaa.none
    client_id: ci
    resource_ids: none
    authorized_grant_types: client_credentials
    autoapprove:
    action: none
    authorities: bosh.admin
    name: ci
    lastmodified: 1469727130702
    id: ci
    </pre>

1. Set the client and secret as environment variables on the VM.

	<pre class='terminal'>
   $ ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-12:~$ export BOSH_CLIENT=ci
  	$ ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-12:~$ export BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=CI-SECRET
	</pre>

1. Target BOSH using the client. Replace `OPS-MANAGER-DIRECTOR-IP` with the IP address of your Ops Manager Director VM.

	<pre class='terminal'>
  	$ bosh --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate \
  	target OPS-MANAGER-DIRECTOR-IP
	</pre>
  
You can now use the UAA client you created to run BOSH in automated or scripted environments, such as continuous integration pipelines.

## SAML Authentication to the BOSH Director

Typically, there is no browser access to a BOSH Director in order to authenticate using SAML. 
Ops Manager provides an option to create UAA clients during SAML configuration so that BOSH can be automated via scripts and tooling. 

1. Select **Provision an admin client in the Bosh UAA** when configuring Ops Manager for SAML.

2. After deploying Ops Manager Director (BOSH), click the Credentials tab in the Ops Manager Director tile.

3. Click the link for the **Uaa Bosh Client Credentials** to get the client name and secret.

4. Open a terminal and SSH into the Ops Manager VM. Provide your SSH key, or, when prompted, enter the password you configured for SSH access during Ops Manager deployment.
   <pre class='terminal'>
    $ ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN
    Password: ***********
   </pre>
  
5. Set the client and secret as environment variables on the VM.
   <pre class='terminal'>
    $ ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-12:~$ export BOSH\_CLIENT=bosh\_admin\_client
    $ ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-12:~$ export BOSH\_CLIENT\_SECRET=CLIENT\_SECRET
   </pre>

6. Target BOSH using the client. Replace `OPS-MANAGER-DIRECTOR-IP` with the IP address of your Ops Manager Director VM.
   <pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate \
    target OPS-MANAGER-DIRECTOR-IP
   </pre>
