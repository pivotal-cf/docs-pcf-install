This topic describes how to configure the Ops Manager Director for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## <a id='access-om'></a>Step 1: Access Ops Manager ##

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of Ops Manager that you set up in [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on GCP](./gcp-om-deploy.html). 

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In order to set up authentication correctly, Pivotal recommends using a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to access Ops Manager. Using an ephemeral IP address to access Ops Manager can cause authentication errors. If you have not configured a FQDN, use the external static IP address of Ops Manager. In the left navigation panel of the GCP Console, click <strong>Compute Engine</strong>, and select <strong>VM Instances</strong>. Locate the Ops Manager VM you created in the <a href="./gcp-om-deploy.html">Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on GCP</a> topic, and copy the <strong>External IP</strong>.</p>

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider (IdP) ###

<%= partial 'using_idp_ops_manager' %> 

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable if lost.
    * If you are using an **Http proxy** or **Https proxy**, follow these [instructions](./pcf-director-proxy-settings.html).
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

## <a id='gcp-config'></a>Step 2: Google Cloud Platform Config ##

1. Click the **Ops Manager Director** tile.
1. Select **Google Config**. Complete the following fields:
    * **Project ID**: Enter your GCP project ID in all lower case, such as: <code>your-gcp-project-id</code>. 
    * **Default Deployment Tag**: Enter `pcf-vms`. 
    * Select an authentication mechanism for the Ops Manager VM:
       * **The Ops Manager VM Service Account**: This option corresponds to the service account automatically generated by GCP for the Ops Manager VM. Do not select this option.
       * **AuthJSON**: Select this option, and enter the contents of the JSON file that you downloaded in the [Set up an IAM Service Account](./gcp-prepare-env.html#iam_account) section of the _Preparing to Deploy PCF on GCP_ topic.

            <%= image_tag("gcp/google_config.png") %>
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='director-config'></a>Step 3: Director Config Page ##

1. Select **Director Config** to open the **Director Config** page.

    <%= image_tag("gcp/director_gcp.png") %>

1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter `169.254.169.254`.

1. (Optional) If you are using [JMX Bridge](./../customizing/use-metrics.html), enter your **Metrics IP Address**.

1. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** checkbox to enable the Ops
Manager Resurrector functionality and increase Elastic Runtime availability.

1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** to run a post-deploy script after deployment. This script allows the job to execute additional commands against a deployment.

1. Select **Recreate all VMs** to force BOSH to recreate all VMs on the next deploy. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.

1. Select **Enable bosh deploy retries** if you want Ops Manager to retry failed BOSH operations up to five times.

1. (Optional) Select **HM Pager Duty Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with PagerDuty.
    <%= image_tag("images/director_hm_pager.png") %>
    * **Service Key**: Enter your API service key from PagerDuty.
    * **HTTP Proxy**: Enter an HTTP proxy for use with PagerDuty.

1. (Optional) Select **HM Email Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with email.
     <%= image_tag("images/director_hm_email.png") %>
    * **Host**: Enter your email hostname.
    * **Port**: Enter your email port number.
    * **Domain**: Enter your domain.
    * **From**: Enter the address for the sender.
    * **Recipients**: Enter comma-separated addresses of intended recipients.
    * **Username**: Enter the username for your email server.
    * **Password**: Enter the password password for your email server.
    * **Enable TLS**: Select this checkbox to enable Transport Layer Security.

1. For **Blobstore Location**, select **Internal**.

1. For **Database Location**, select **Internal**.

1. **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the Ops Manager Director can run simultaneously. Pivotal recommends that you leave the field blank to use the default value, unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.

1. Enter a **Director Hostname** to add a custom URL for your BOSH Director host. Make sure you have already set up a DNS entry for this hostname.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='az'></a>Step 4: Create Availability Zones Page ##

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Pivotal recommends at least three Availability Zones for a highly available installation of Elastic Runtime.</p>

1. Select **Create Availability Zones**.
1. Use the following steps to create one or more Availability Zones for your applications to use:
    * Click **Add**.
    * For **Google Availability Zone**, enter a zone that matches the region. For example, if you are using the `us-central1` region, you can enter `us-central1-a` or `us-central1-b`. For help selecting the zones for your deployment, see the [Google documentation on regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones).

    <%= image_tag("gcp/availability_zones.png") %>
1. Repeat the above step for as many zones as you need. When you are done, click **Save**.

## <a id='network'></a>Step 5: Create Networks Page ##
1. Select **Create Networks**.
1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. If checked, Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable. Leave this box unchecked if ICMP is disabled on your network.
1. Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    * If you want to dynamically provision VMs in this network for use with on-demand services, select the **Service Networks** checkbox. When the checkbox is selected, Ops Manager does not provision VMs within the specified **CIDR** range.
    * Under **Subnets**, complete the following fields:
        * **Google Network Name**: Enter the network, subnet and region names of the Google Network you created in [Preparing to Deploy PCF on GCP](./gcp-prepare-env.html#create_network). The format is `NETWORK-NAME/SUBNET-NAME/REGION-NAME`. For example, `opsmgr/central/us-central1`.
        * **CIDR**: Enter `10.0.0.0/20`. Ops Manager deploy VMs to this CIDR block. 
        * **Reserved IP Ranges**: Enter `10.0.0.1-10.0.0.9`. Ops Manager avoids deploying VMs to any IP address in this range. 
        * **DNS**: Enter `8.8.8.8`.
        * **Gateway**: Enter `10.0.0.1`.
        * **Availbaility Zones**: Select your availability zone.
    * If you want to add more subnets, click **Add Subnet**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using multiple Availability Zones, you must add a new network with at least one subnet for each Availability Zone.</p>
    <%= image_tag("gcp/create-networks.png") %>
1. Click **Save**.

1. If the following ICMP error message appears, you can ignore the warning. Dismiss the warning, and move on to the next step.

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/config-error.png") %>

## <a id="assign-azs"></a>Step 6: Assign AZs and Networks Page##

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**.
<%= image_tag("gcp/assign_azs.png") %>
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Singleton Availability Zone**. The Ops Manager Director installs in this Availability Zone.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Network** for your Ops Manager Director.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='security'></a>Step 7: Security Page ##

1. Select **Security**.
    <%= image_tag("../images/om-security.png") %>

1. In **Trusted Certificates**, enter a custom certificate authority (CA) certificate to insert into your organization's certificate trust chain. This feature enables all BOSH-deployed components in your deployment to trust a custom root certificate. If you want to use Docker Trusted Registries for running app instances in Docker containers, use this field to enter your certificate for your private Docker Trusted Registry. See the [Using Docker Trusted Registries](../opsguide/docker-registry.html) topic for more information.
1. Choose **Generate passwords** or **Use default BOSH password**. Pivotal recommends that you use the **Generate passwords** option for greater security.
1. Click **Save**. To view your saved Director password, click the **Credentials** tab.

## <a id='resource-config'></a>Step 8: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.
<%= image_tag("gcp/om_resource_config.png") %>
1. Ensure that the **Internet Connected** checkboxes are selected for all jobs. This gives all VMs a public IP address that enables outbound Internet access.
   <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to provision a Network Address Translation (NAT) box to provide Internet connectivity to your VMs instead of providing them with public IP addresses, deselect the <strong>Internet Connected</strong> checkboxes. For more information on using NAT in GCP, see the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking">GCP documentation</a>.</p>  

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields, choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p> 

## <a id='complete'></a>Step 9: Complete the Ops Manager Director Installation ##

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
Dashboard.

1. Click **Apply Changes**. If the following ICMP error message appears, return to the [**Network Config** screen](#network), and deselect the **Enable ICMP Checks** box. 

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/install-error.png") %>

1. Ops Manager Director installs. This may take a few moments. When the installation process successfully completes, the **Changes Applied** window appears.

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/ops-manager-complete.png") %>
