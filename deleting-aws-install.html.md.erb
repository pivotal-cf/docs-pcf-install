When you deploy <%= vars.platform_name %> to Amazon Web Services (AWS), you provision a set of resources.
This topic describes how to delete the AWS resources associated with an <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.
You can use the AWS console to remove an installation of all components,
but retain the objects in your bucket for a future deployment.
