This topic describes how to configure the Pivotal Elastic Runtime components
that you need to run <a
href="https://network.pivotal.io/productsf/pivotal-cf">Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>
(PCF) on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

***<p class="tip">CAUTION: Pivotal strongly recommends installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry using AWS CloudFormation, as described in [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on AWS](./cloudform.html), rather than configuring AWS manually as documented here.</p>***

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites ##

Before following this procedure, complete all of the steps in the [Configuring Ops Manager Director for AWS](./pcf-aws-manual-om-config.html) topics.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you plan to <a href = "http://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html">install the PCF IPsec add-on</a>, you must do so before installing any other tiles. Pivotal recommends installing IPsec immediately after Ops Manager, and before installing the Elastic Runtime tile.</p>

## <a id='om-add'></a>Step 1: Add Elastic Runtime to Ops Manager ##

1. Navigate to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager Installation
Dashboard.

1. Click the Pivotal Network link on the left to add Elastic Runtime to Ops
Manager.

    For more information, refer to the [Adding and Deleting Products](./add-delete.html) topic.

1. Click the Elastic Runtime tile in the Installation Dashboard.

    <%= image_tag("images/er-tile.png") %>

## <a id='az-networks'></a>Step 2: Assign Availability Zones and Networks ##

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**. These are the Availability Zones that you [create](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#create-az) when configuring Ops Manager Director.

1. Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**. Ops Manager runs any job with a single instance in this Availability Zone.

1. Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**. Ops Manager balances instances of jobs with more than one instance across the Availability Zones that you specify.
    
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends at least three Availability Zones for a highly available installation of Elastic Runtime.</p>

1. Select the network that you created in the [Networks Pages](./pcf-aws-manual-om-config.html#pcfaws-om-networks) section of the _Configuring Ops Manager Director for AWS_ topic.
<%= image_tag("er-az.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you save this form, a verification error displays because the PCF security group blocks ICMP. You can ignore this error.</p>
    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er-network-error.png") %>

## <a id='er-domain-config'></a>Step 3: Configure Domains ##

1. Select **Domains**.

    <%= image_tag("domains.png") %>

1. Enter the system and application domains.
    * The **System Domain** defines your target when you push apps to Elastic
      Runtime.
    * The **Apps Domain** defines where Elastic Runtime should serve your apps.

    <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Pivotal recommends that you use the same domain name but different subdomain names for your system and app domains. This prevents system and apps routes from overlapping. You will require two DNS entries: one for the system and the other for apps. For example,  <code>system.EXAMPLE.COM</code> and <code>apps.EXAMPLE.COM</code>. Point both domains to your internal router IP address, which you can find under the status tab in the Elastic Runtime tile.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You configured a wildcard DNS record
    for these domains in an earlier step.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id="networking"></a>Step 4: Configure Networking ##

<%= partial 'networking-cloudform' %>

## <a id='db-config'></a>Step 5: Configure System Databases ##

You can configure Elastic Runtime to use the internal MySQL database provided with PCF, or you can configure an external database provider for the databases required by Elastic Runtime.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are performing an upgrade, do not modify your existing internal database configuration or you may lose data. You must migrate your existing data first before changing the configuration. See <a href="upgrading-pcf.html">Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> for additional upgrade information.</p>

###<a id='internal-db'></a> Internal Database Configuration

<%= partial 'ert_database_internal' %>

Then proceed to [Step 6: (Optional) Configure Internal MySQL](#internal-mysql) to configure high availability and automatic backups for your internal MySQL databases.

###<a id='create-dbs'></a> External Database Configuration

<%= partial 'ert_database_external' %>

## <a id='internal-mysql'></a> Step 6: (Optional) Configure Internal MySQL ##

<%= partial 'mysql_proxy_config' %>

## <a id='application-containers-config'></a>Step 7: Configure Application Containers ##

<%= partial 'application_container_config' %>

## <a id='er-appdevctrl-config'></a>Step 8: Configure Application Developer Controls ##

1. Select **Application Developer Controls**.

    <%= image_tag("er17-config-appdevctrl.png") %>

1. Enter your intended maximum file upload size.

1. Enter your default RAM memory allocation per app.

1. Enter your default total RAM memory (RAM) quota per Org. You can change this in the CLI.

1. Enter your maximum and default disk quotas per app.

1. Enter your default service instances quota per Org. You can change this in the CLI.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='app-security'></a>Step 9: Review Application Security Group ##

<%= partial 'application_security_group' %>

## <a id='er-auth-config'></a>Step 10: Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO ##

<%= partial 'authsso_config' %>

## <a id='file-store-config'></a>Step 11: Configure File Storage ##

<%= partial 'filestore_config' %>

For PCF deployments on AWS, the recommended selection is **External S3-Compatible File Store**.

For more factors to consider when selecting file storage, see <a href="../opsguide/storage_considerations.html">Considerations for Selecting File Storage in Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>. 

### <a id='internal_filestore'></a> Internal Filestore

<%= partial 'filestore_internal' %>

### <a id='external_s3'></a> External S3 or Ceph Filestore

<%= partial 'filestore_s3_config' %>

### <a id='other'></a> Other IaaS Storage Options

[Google Cloud Storage](./gcp-er-config.html#external_gcp) and [Azure Storage](./gcp-er-config.html#external_azure) are also available as file storage options but are not recommended for typical PCF on AWS installations. 

## <a id='config-sys-logging'></a>Step 12: (Optional) Configure System Logging ##

If you are forwarding logging messages to an external Reliable Event Logging Protocol (RELP) server, complete the following steps:

1. Select **System Logging**.
  <%= image_tag("cloudform/sys-logging.png") %>
  
1. If you want to include security events in your log stream, select the **Enable Cloud Controller security event logging** checkbox. This logs all API requests, including the endpoint, user, source IP, and request result, in the Common Event Format (CEF).

1. Enter the IP address of your syslog server in **External Syslog Aggregator Hostname** and its port in **External Syslog Aggregator Port**. The default port for a syslog server is 514.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The host must be reachable from the Elastic Runtime network, accept TCP connections, and use the RELP protocol. Ensure your syslog server listens on external interfaces.</p>
1. Select an **External Syslog Network Protocol** to use when forwarding logs.
1. For the **Syslog Drain Buffer Size**, enter the number of messages the Doppler server can hold from Metron agents before the server starts to drop them. See the [Loggregator Guide for Cloud Foundry Operators](../loggregator/log-ops-guide.html) topic for more details.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='lb'></a>Step 13: Finalize the Load Balancer Setup ##

<%= partial 'configure_aws_elb' %>

## <a id='customize-apps-man'></a>Step 14: (Optional) Customize Apps Manager##

<%= partial 'custombranding' %>

## <a id='smtp'></a>Step 15: (Optional) Configure Email Notifications ##

Elastic Runtime uses SMTP to send invitations and confirmations to Apps Manager
users.
You must complete the **Email Notifications** page if you want to enable
end-user self-registration.

1. Select **Email Notifications**.
  <%= image_tag("cloudform/smtp.png") %>

1. Enter your reply-to and SMTP email information

1. For **SMTP Authentication Mechanism**, select `None`.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not configure the SMTP
settings using this form, the administrator must create orgs and users using
the cf CLI tool. See <a href="../adminguide/cli-user-management.html">Creating and Managing Users with the cf CLI</a> for more information.</p>

## <a id='ccdb-key'></a>Step 16: (Optional) Add CCDB Restore Key##

<%= partial 'restore_ccdb_key' %>

## <a id='config-smoke-test'></a>Step 17: Configure Smoke Tests ##

<%= partial '_smoketests' %>

## <a id='advanced-features'></a>Step 18: (Optional) Enable Advanced Features

Use caution when enabling advanced features if you have other Pivotal Cloud Foundry service tiles installed in your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment. Not all of the services are guaranteed to work as expected with these features enabled.

### <a id="disk-memory-overcommit"></a>Diego Cell Memory and Disk Overcommit

If your apps do not use the full allocation of disk space and memory set in the **Resource Config** tab, you might want use this feature. These fields control the amount to overcommit disk and memory resources to each Diego Cell VM.

For example, you might want to use the overcommit if your apps use a small amount of disk and memory capacity compared with the **Resource Config** settings for **Diego Cell**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Due to the risk of app failure and the deployment-specific nature of disk and memory use, Pivotal has no recommendation about how much, if any, memory or disk space to overcommit.</p>

To enable overcommit, follow these steps:

1. Select **Advanced Features**.

    <%= image_tag("./disk-memory-overcommit.png") %>

1. Enter the total desired amount of Diego cell memory value in the **Cell Memory Capacity (MB)** field. Refer to the **Diego Cell** row in the **Resource Config** tab for the current Cell memory capacity settings that this field overrides.

1. Enter the total desired amount of Diego cell disk capacity value in the **Cell Disk Capacity (MB)** field. Refer to the **Diego Cell** row in the **Resource Config** tab for the current Cell disk capacity settings that this field overrides.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Entries made to each of these two fields set the total amount of resources allocated, not the overage.</p>

### <a id="enable-tcp"></a>Enable TCP Routing

TCP Routing is available for users who want an alternative to HTTP. For more information, including details about setting up your networking infrastructure for TCP Routing, see [Enabling TCP Routing](../adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html). 

1. TCP Routing is disabled by default. To enable this feature, select the **Enable TCP Routing** radio button. 

    <%= image_tag("./tcp_routing.png") %>

1. You do not need to enter **TCP Router IPs** if you are using an ELB. Instead, navigate to <strong>Resource Config</strong> and, in the **TCP Router** job, enter your **ELB Name**.

1. In **TCP Routing Ports**, enter the range of ports you reserved for TCP routes. These ports must be available on your load balancer. You can specify a list of ports with commas between each port number and specify ranges of ports with dashes between the first and last port number. This configuration only applies the first time you specify it here. If you later want to update the ports, see the [HTTP vs TCP Routes](../devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#http-vs-tcp-routes) topic on how to use the cf CLI to update TCP Routing ports.

### <a id="disable-tcp"></a>Disable TCP Routing

1. If you want to disable TCP routing after enabling it, click **Select this option if you prefer to enable TCP Routing at a later time**.

1. Manually remove the TCP routing domain. 

## <a id='errands'></a>Step 19: Configure Errands ##

<%= partial 'errands' %>

## <a id='disable-resources'></a>Step 20: (Optional) Disable Unused Resources ##

<%= partial 'disable_resources' %>

## <a id='stemcell'></a>Step 21: Download Stemcell ##

This step is only required if your Ops Manager does not already have the Stemcell version required by Elastic Runtime.

1. Select **Stemcell**.

1. Log into the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) and click on **Stemcells**.

1. Download the appropriate stemcell version targeted for your IaaS.

1. In Ops Manager, import the downloaded stemcell <code>.tgz</code> file.

    <%= image_tag("stemcell_18.png") %>


## <a id='config-elb'></a>Step 22: Configure Router to Elastic Load Balancer ##

1. In the **Elastic Runtime** tile, click **Resource Config**.

1. In the **ELB Name** field of the **TCP Router** row, enter the name of your TOC load balancer if you have enabled TCP routing in the [Advanced Features](#advanced-features) pane. Specify multiple load balancers by entering the names separated by commas.

1. In the **ELB Name** field of the **Diego Brain** row, enter the name of your SSH load balancer. Specify multiple load balancers by entering the names separated by commas.


1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er-aws-resource-config.png") %>
