title: Recovering from an Ops Manager and PAS Upgrade Failure
owner: Platform Recovery

This topic explains how to use BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) to restore Ops Manager
and Pivotal Application Service (PAS) back to a healthy state after a failed upgrade
between PAS minor versions.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> BBR can only restore across the same PAS minor
  versions. See <code>metadata/cf-VERSION.yml</code> in the backup artifact to verify
which version of PAS was used to create the backup artifact.</p>

## <a id="evaluate"></a>Evaluate Your Deployment

You can restore Ops Manager and PAS to a healthy state after a failed upgrade between
PAS minor versions if your backups, BOSH Director, and PAS deployment meet certain
conditions. Follow the procedures in this section to confirm that your deployment
can be restored by BBR.

### <a id="review-backup"></a>Review Your Backup

Before you perform a restore, you must do the following:

1. Run the following `bbr` commands from your Ops Manager VM:
  + Back up your deployments by running the following command:

        ```
        bbr deployment --deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME backup
        ```
  + Back up your BOSH Director by running the following command:

        ```
        bbr director backup
        ```
        The above `bbr` commands produce the following backup artifacts:

        + `DEPLOYMENT_NAME_TIMESTAMP/`
        + `DIRECTOR_IP_TIMESTAMP/`
        + `installation.zip`

1. Export your Ops Manager settings. For more information, see the [Settings Page](../../pcf-interface.html#settings)
section of _Using the Ops Manager Interface_.

### <a id="validating-environment-restore"></a>Validate Your Environment for Restore

Before you can restore after a failed upgrade between PAS minor versions, you must
confirm that your BOSH Director and PAS deployment are healthy.

#### <a id="bosh-director"></a>Confirm That Your BOSH Director Is Healthy

To check that the BOSH Director is in a healthy state for a `bbr restore`, SSH to
the Ops Manager VM and ensure that all jobs are running.

To make sure that all jobs are running, do the following:

1. SSH into your BOSH Director. For more information, see [Log in to the BOSH
Director VM with SSH](../../trouble-advanced.html#bosh-director-ssh) in _Advanced
Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_.

1. View all deployment job instances by running the following command:

	```
	monit summary
	```
Monit should report that all jobs are `running`.

1. Ensure that the BOSH API is responsive by running the following command:

	```
	bosh configs
	```

    If this command runs successfully, then the BOSH Director API is in a healthy
    and responsive state and can be restored by BBR.

If your BOSH Director is unhealthy, see [Restoring an Unhealthy BOSH Director](#unhealthy-bosh) below.

####<a id="pas"></a>Confirm That Your PAS Deployment Is Healthy

To confirm that PAS is in a healthy state, run the following command:

```
bosh -d PAS-DEPLOYMENT-NAME instances
```
Where `PAS-DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name of your PAS BOSH deployment.

If your PAS deployment is healthy, then the output states that all of your instances
are in the `running` state. If all instances are running, PAS can be restored by BBR.

If your PAS deployment is unhealthy, see [Restoring an Unhealthy PAS Deployment](failed-pas-upgrade.html#unhealthy-pas).

## <a id="restore"></a>Restore Your Deployment

After you confirm that your BOSH Director is healthy with its data intact, and
all instances in your PAS deployment are responsive, you can restore PAS with BBR.

### <a id="healthy-bosh-healthy-pas"></a>Restoring PAS

If your BOSH Director is healthy, you can restore across the same PAS minor version
by following the procedures in [Step 13: Restore PAS](../restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-ert)
in _Restoring PCF from Backup with BBR_.

##<a id="recover"></a>Recover to a Healthy State

If either the BOSH Director or PAS are not in a healthy state, they must be recovered
before you can run `bbr restore`. If you need guidance on the following subsections,
contact [Pivotal Support](https://support.pivotal.io/).

###<a id="unhealthy-bosh"></a>Restoring an Unhealthy BOSH Director

If the BOSH Director is not in a healthy state, Pivotal recommends following our
full restore workflow to regain your Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and BOSH deployments.

See [Restore Workflow](../restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-diagram) in _Restoring PCF from Backup with BBR_.

###<a id="unhealthy-pas"></a>Restoring an Unhealthy PAS Deployment

If your BOSH Director is healthy, you can restore your previous BOSH Director state
by following [Step 8: Restore the BOSH Director](../restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-bosh)
in _Restoring PCF from Backup with BBR_.

After your BOSH Director is restored, you can then restore your deployments by following
[Step 13: Restore PAS](../restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-ert) in _Restoring PCF from Backup with BBR_.
