To minimize system downtime, Pivotal recommends using highly resilient and redundant _external_ filestores for your Pivotal Application Service (PAS) file storage. 

When configuring file storage for the Cloud Controller in PAS, you can select one of the following:

* Internal WebDAV filestore
* External S3-compatible or Ceph-compatible filestore
* External Google Cloud Storage with Access Key and Secret Key
* External Google Cloud Storage with Service Account
* External Azure Cloud Storage
