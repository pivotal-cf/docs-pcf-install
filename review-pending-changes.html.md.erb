This topic describes the **Review Pending Changes** page and how to selectively deploy
individual or multiple tiles in Ops Manager. Deploying tiles selectively can drastically
reduce deployment time.

The following screenshot shows the **Review Pending Changes** page. Features called out with
red letters are described below.

	    Changes' page. For a description of each labeled section, see the list
	    below.") %></a>

Each labeled section of the **Review Pending Changes** page works as follows:

- **A**---**Select All Products:** When enabled, the checkbox selects all available
products. When disabled, the checkbox deselects all available products.

- **B**---**Select Product:** The checkboxes next to each product listing allow you to select the tiles you want to deploy.
The BOSH Director is always selected.

- **C**---**Product Listing:** Each product listing displays the version of the product
staged for deployment. The top of each listing shows one of the following three colors:

  - **Green**---Tile is configured and ready for deployment.

  - **Orange**---Tile is not fully configured and cannot be deployed yet.

  - **Red**---Tile is pending deletion.

- **D**---**Depends on:** This section lists tile dependencies and versions. If you choose
to deploy a tile that has dependencies, you must also deploy all of that tile's
dependencies in the same deployment.

- **E**---**Warnings:**---Red text in orange product listings indicates changes you need to make before you deploy the tile.
You might see some of the following warnings:

    - **Missing stemcell**---You must import and stage a stemcell with Stemcell Library. The warning
    links to the Stemcell Library.

    - **Stemcell out of date**---You must update the stemcell of your tile in Stemcell
    Library. For more information, see [Importing and Managing Stemcells](../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).

    - **Configuration is incomplete**---You must complete the configuration of your tile.

    - **Configuration is invalid**---You must resolve your tile's invalid configurations.


- **F**---**Changes:** This section lists high-level pending changes to the product that Ops Manager has not yet attempted to deploy. When Ops Manager tries to deploy a product but the deployment fails, it clears this list and the pending changes are retained for the next deployment. To see if your product deployed successfully, see
[Change Log Page](./pcf-interface.html#changelog).<br><br>
    Listed changes include:

    - Tile deletion is staged.

    - Tile version is updated.

    - Stemcell is updated.

- **G**---**Errands:** If you expand this section, you can enable or disable errands that trigger when that tile
deploys. For example, you may enable an errand to log properties. For more information,
see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](./managing_errands.html).

- **H**--**Staged**: This section indicates the status of the tile.

- **I**--**See Changes**: Clicking this button takes you to the [Pending Changes](#pending-changes) page for that tile.

- **J**---**Apply Changes:** Clicking this button deploys all enabled tiles.
