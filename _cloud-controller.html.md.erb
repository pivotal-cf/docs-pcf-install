1. Click **Cloud Controller**. The following image shows the **Configure the Cloud Controller** page.

	![There is a heading at the top of the Cloud Controller page that says Configure the Cloud Controller. There are several fields on the Cloud Controller page. The first three fields are Cloud Controller DB Encryption Key, Enabling CF API Rate Limiting, and Database Connection Validation Timeout. There is a Save button at the bottom of the page.](images/config-cc.png)

1. Enter your **Cloud Controller DB Encryption Key** if all of the following are true:
  * You deployed Pivotal Application Service (PAS) previously.
  * You then stopped PAS or it crashed.
  * You are re-deploying PAS with a backup of your Cloud Controller database.
  <br><br>
  See [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry](./backup-restore/index.html) for more information.

1. CF API Rate Limiting prevents API consumers from overwhelming the platform API servers. Limits are imposed on a per-user or per-client basis and reset on an hourly interval. 
	<br><br>
	To disable CF API Rate Limiting, select **Disable** under **Enable CF API Rate Limiting**. To enable CF API Rate Limiting, perform the following steps:
	
	1. Under **Enable CF API Rate Limiting**, select **Enable**.
	1. For **General Limit**, enter the number of requests a user or client is allowed to make over an hour interval for all endpoints that do not have a custom limit. The default value is `2000`.
	1. For **Unauthenticated Limit**, enter the number of requests an unauthenticated client is allowed to make over an hour interval. The default value is `100`.

1. (Optional) Enter in seconds your **Database Connection Validation Timeout**. By
default, the setting is `3600` seconds or 60 minutes. You can enter `-1` to cause Cloud
Controller to make an additional query to the database whenever connections are checked out from
the pool. Choosing `-1` has performance implications.

1. (Optional) Enter in seconds your **Database Read Timeout**. By default, the setting is `3600`
seconds or 60 minutes.

1. Enter `X` to acknowledge that there are no apps running on `cflinuxfs2` in your deployment. If you are upgrading from PCF v2.4 and your deployment still has apps running on `cflinuxfs2`, see [Migrate Apps to cflinuxfs3](../upgrading/checklist.html#cflinuxfs3) in _Upgrade Preparation Checklist for PCF v2.5_. You can proceed with your upgrade once there are no longer any apps running on `cflinuxfs2`. For additional information, see [PAS Only Supports cflinuxfs3](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#cflinuxfs3) in _PAS v2.5 Release Notes_.
