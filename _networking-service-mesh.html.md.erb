PAS includes an optional, beta routing plane that uses a service mesh. A service mesh provides traffic management, security, and observability for microservices. It enables new features such as weighted routing. For more information, see [Service Mesh (Beta)](../adminguide/service-mesh.html). 

To add service mesh to your deployment, do the following:

1. Under **Service Mesh (Beta)**, select **Enable**. 

1. For **IP Addresses for Ingress Router**, do the following depending on your IaaS:
	* **vSphere**: Enter static IPs for the Istio Routers. You must configure your load balancer with these IPs as well. 
	* **Other**: Leave this field blank. 

1. For **Ingress Router TLS Keypairs**, complete the following fields. You can add more than one keypair if desired using the **Add** button.
	* **Name**: Enter a name for the keypair. 
	* **Certificate and Private Key for Istio Router**: Enter the Private key and certificate for TLS handshakes with clients. These must be in PEM block format. 

1. Click **Save**. 

1. Create a load balancer and add it to the **Resource Config** pane as described in [Deploying Service Mesh (Beta)](../opsguide/deploying-service-mesh.html).
