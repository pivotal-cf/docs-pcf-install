title: Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR
owner: RelEng
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<% $this_topic = 'backup-pcf' %>

This topic describes the procedure for backing up your critical backend Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) components with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR), a command-line tool for backing up and restoring BOSH deployments. To restore your backup, see the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

To view the BBR release notes, see the [BOSH Backup and Restore Release Notes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/bbr-rn.html).

During the backup, BBR stops the Cloud Controller API and the Cloud Controller workers to create a consistent backup. Only the API functionality, like pushing applications or using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) are affected. The deployed applications do not experience downtime.

<div class="note warning">
  <strong>WARNING</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Backup artifacts can contain secrets. Secure backup artifacts by using encryption or other means. </li>
    <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> A BBR backup can only be restored to environments matching its source environment. 
      To ensure that a restore environment is compatible with a backup see <a href="#restore-compatibility">Compatibility of Restore</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Failed Restore:</strong> Restore is a destructive operation. BBR is designed to restore PCF after a disaster. 
      If a restore fails, the environment might be left in an unusable state and require re-provisioning. For more information, 
      see <a href="restore-pcf-bbr.html">Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR</a>.</li>      
    <li><strong>Service Data:</strong> BBR does not back up any service data.</li>
    <li><strong>API Outage:</strong> The Cloud Controller API does not send or receive calls during PCF restoration.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## <a id='recs'></a> Recommendations

Pivotal recommends the following:

* Follow the full procedure documented in this topic when creating a backup. This ensures that you always have a consistent backup of Ops Manager and PAS to restore from.
* Back up frequently, especially before making any changes to your PCF deployment, such as the configuration of any tiles in Ops Manager.

## <a id='supported'></a> Supported Components

BBR is a binary that can back up and restore BOSH deployments and BOSH Directors.
BBR requires that the backup targets supply scripts that implement the backup and restore functions.
BBR can communicate securely with external blobstores and databases, using TLS, if these are configured accordingly.

BBR can back up the following components:

- [Pivotal Application Service (PAS)](#pas-support)
- [BOSH Director](#bosh-director-support)

### <a id='pas-support'></a> PAS
In PCF v2.2, BBR can back up and restore PAS configured with the following:

* An internal MySQL database or a supported external database.
For a list of supported external databases, see the
[Supported External Databases](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/cf-backup.html#supported-external-databases) section
of _Configuring Cloud Foundry for BOSH Backup and Restore_ in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

* An internal WebDAV/NFS blobstore, an external Amazon S3 or S3-compatible blobstore, or an external Azure blobstore.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In PAS v2.2, BBR supports backing up and restoring versioned and unversioned S3 or
  S3-compatible blobstores by default. To back up and restore Azure blobstores
  with BBR, you must install Blobstore Addon. For more information, see
  <a href="./enabling-external-blobstore-backups.html">Enabling External Blobstore Backups</a>.
</p>

For guidance about backing up unsupported databases and blobstores, see
[Unsupported External Blobstores and Databases in PAS](#guidelines).

### <a id='bosh-director-support'></a> BOSH Director

The BOSH Director must have an internal PostgreSQL database and an internal blobstore
to be backed up and restored with BBR. As part of backing up the BOSH Director, BBR backs up the BOSH UAA
database and the CredHub database.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: BBR support for backing up and restoring external databases and
  blobstores varies across PCF versions. For more information, see
  <a href="#version-compatibility">External Storage Support Across PCF Versions</a>.
</p>

## <a id="version-compatibility"></a> External Storage Support Across PCF Versions

The following table shows what types of external databases and blobstores you can back up and restore
with BBR in PCF v1.11 through v2.3.

## <a id="guidelines"></a> Unsupported External Blobstores and Databases in PAS

If you configured an unsupported external blobstore or an unsupported external database in PAS, see the following guidelines to perform a backup successfully:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Scenario</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You configured a supported database and an unsupported external blobstore in PAS.</td>
    <td>Follow the PCF backup process and copy the external blobstore by using the IaaS-specific tool.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You configured an unsupported external database and a supported blobstore in PAS.</td>
    <td>Follow the PCF backup process and copy the external database by using the IaaS-specific tool.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You configured both an unsupported external database and an unsupported external blobstore in PAS.</td>
    <td>Follow the PCF backup process but skip <a href="#bbr-backup">Back Up Your PAS Deployment</a>. Copy the external database and blobstore by using the IaaS-specific tool.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> You might encounter inconsistencies between the blobstore and database. If apps do not appear during a restore, re-push those apps.</p>

## <a id='backup-services'></a> Backing Up Services

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> BBR does <strong>not</strong> currently back up any service data.</p>

Keep in mind the following when backing up services:

* BBR backs up and restores the service bindings, but not the service data.
* You can redeploy on-demand service instances manually during restore, but the data in the instance is not backed up.
* BBR does not back up managed services or their data.
* You can back up and restore brokered services with the procedures documented in this topic and in the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

## <a id='workflow'></a> Backup Workflow

To install BBR, you download the `bbr` executable and copy it to a jumpbox. Once installed on your jumpbox, you can run BBR commands, specifying the name of the BOSH deployment.

BBR examines the jobs in the BOSH deployment, and triggers the scripts in the following stages:

1. **Pre-backup lock**: The pre-backup lock scripts locks the job so backups are consistent across the cluster.
1. **Backup**: The backup script backs up the release.
1. **Post-backup unlock**: The post-backup unlock script unlocks the job after the backup is complete.

Scripts in the same stage are all triggered together. For instance, BBR triggers all pre-backup lock scripts before any backup scripts. Scripts within a stage can be triggered in any order.

The backup artifacts are drained to the jumpbox, where the operator can transfer them to storage and use them to restore PCF.

The following diagram shows a sample backup flow.

<%= image_tag('backup-flow.png') %>

## <a id='prepare'></a> Preparing to Create Your Backup

### <a id='setup-jumpbox'></a> Step 1: Set Up Your Jumpbox

You must have a jumpbox before you can install BBR to the jumpbox. A jumpbox is a separate,
hardened server on your network that provides a controlled means of access to the VMs other
computers on your network. Pivotal recommends using the Ops Manager VM as your jumpbox.

Pivotal recommends using the Ops Manager VM as your jumpbox. If you use the Ops Manager VM as your jumpbox, 
the path to the root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate is:

```
/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
```

You must have this path to run BBR commands.

Prepare your jumpbox for BBR by following the steps in [Setting Up Your Jumpbox for BBR](system-setup-bbr.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pivotal recommends that you regularly update the BBR binary on your jumpbox to the latest version. 
  See <a href="system-setup-bbr.html#scp">Transfer BBR Binary to Your Jumpbox</a> in <em>Setting Up Your Jumpbox for BBR</em> for more information.
See the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/jumpbox-deployment">jumpbox-deployment</a> GitHub repository for an example jumpbox deployment.
</p>

### <a id='encrypt-key'></a> Step 2: Record the Cloud Controller Database Encryption Credentials

Perform the following steps to retrieve the Cloud Controller Database encryption credentials from the PAS tile:

1. Navigate to Ops Manager in a browser and log in to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Select PAS **Credentials** and locate the Cloud Controller section.

1. Record the **Db Encryption Credentials**. You must provide these credentials when you contact [Pivotal Support](https://support.pivotal.io) for assistance restoring your installation.

### <a id="retrieve-credentials"></a> Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials

<%= partial 'bosh_retrieve_credentials' %>

### <a id="retrieve-address"></a> Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address

Perform the following steps to retrieve the IP address of your BOSH Director from the BOSH Director tile:

<%= partial 'bosh_target_director_bbr' %>

### <a id='check-director'></a> Step 5: Check Your BOSH Director

Perform the following steps to confirm that your BOSH Director is reachable and can be backed up.  

#### Connect to Your Jumpbox

You can establish a connection to your jumpbox in one of the following ways.

* [Connect with SSH](#ssh)
* [Connect with BOSH&#95;ALL&#95;PROXY](#bosh-all-proxy)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: These procedures require you have a jumpbox configured for SSH access. 
If you do not have a jumpbox, please see <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/jumpbox/">Enabling SSH Access</a> and <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-tunnel/">Tunneling</a> in the BOSH documentation.
</p>

For general information about the jumpbox, see [Setting Up Your Jumpbox for BBR](system-setup-bbr.html).

<a id='ssh'></a> **Connect with SSH**

There are two options available to you to connect to your jumpbox with SSH:  

* Ops Manager VM.  
* SSH via command line.  

1. To connect to your jumpbox via Ops Manager VM, perform the following steps:
    1. Log in to the Ops Manager VM:
    1. If you are using the Ops Manager VM as your jumpbox, see the 
    [Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](../trouble-advanced.html#ssh) section of _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ 
    for information on how to use SSH to connect to the Ops Manager VM. 
1. To connect to your jumpbox via command line, perform the following steps:
    1. Run the following command to SSH into your jumpbox:

        ```
        ssh -i LOCAL-PATH-TO-JUMPBOX-PRIVATE-KEY JUMPBOX-USER@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS
        ```
        Where:  
        * `LOCAL-PATH-TO-JUMPBOX-PRIVATE-KEY`  is the local path to your private key file for the jumpbox host.
        * `JUMPBOX-USER` is your jumpbox username.
        * `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the IP address of your jumpbox.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you connect to your jumpbox with SSH, you must run the BBR commands in the following sections from within your jumpbox.
</p>

<a id='bosh-all-proxy'></a> **Connect with BOSH&#95;ALL&#95;PROXY**

Set and use `BOSH_ALL_PROXY`. Using `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` opens an SSH tunnel with SOCKS5 to the jumpbox. 
This tunnel enables you to forward requests to the BOSH Director through the jumpbox from your local machine.

Use one of the following methods to create the tunnel:

* **Tunnel created by BOSH CLI**: To provide the BOSH CLI with the SSH credentials it needs to create the tunnel, run the following command:

    ```
	 export BOSH_ALL_PROXY=ssh+socks5://JUMPBOX@JUMPBOX-IP:SOCKS-PORT?private_key=JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE
	 ```

    Where:
    * `JUMPBOX` is the name of your jumpbox.
    * `JUMPBOX-IP` is the IP address of the jumpbox.
    * `SOCKS-PORT` is the local SOCKS port.
    * `JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE` is the local SSH private key for accessing the jumpbox.


* **Tunnel established separately**:

  1. To establish the tunnel and make it available on a local port, run the following command:

    ```
    ssh -4 -D SOCKS-PORT -fNC JUMPBOX@JUMPBOX-IP -i JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE
    ```

    Where:
    * `SOCKS-PORT` is the local SOCKS port.
    * `JUMPBOX` is the name of your jumpbox.
    * `JUMPBOX-IP` is the IP address of the jumpbox.
    * `JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE` is the local SSH private key for accessing the jumpbox.

  1. To provide the BOSH CLI with access to the tunnel through use of the `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` environment variable, run the following command:

    ```
    export BOSH_ALL_PROXY=socks5://localhost:12345
    ```

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure the Socks port is not already in use by a different tunnel/process.
</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Using <code>BOSH_ALL_PROXY</code> can result in longer
backup and restore times due to network performance degradation. Because all operations must pass
through the proxy, moving backup artifacts can be significantly slower.
</p>

#### Check Your BOSH Director

1. Run the BBR `pre-backup-check` command:

    ```
  	bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    --username bbr \
    --host HOST \
    pre-backup-check
  	```
  	Where:
  	* `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from 
    **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
  	* `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public,
    `HOST` is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, `HOST` is
    the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` which you retrieved in the
    [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address) section of this topic.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Use the optional <code>--debug</code>
      flag to enable debug logs. See the <a href="#logging">Logging</a> section of
      this topic for more information.</p>

1. After the pre-backup check succeeds, continue to [Step 5: Confirm Backup Restore Node is Deployed](#backup-restore-node) below.  
<br>
If the pre-backup check fails, the BOSH Director might not have the correct backup scripts, or the
connection to the BOSH Director might have failed.

### <a id='backup-restore-node'></a> Step 6: Confirm Backup Restore Node is Deployed

When BBR backs up PAS, it needs a Backup Prepare node. This procedure confirms that the Backup Prepare node is deployed.

1. In Ops Manager, open the **<%= vars.product_full %>** tile.

1. In the **Resource Config** pane find the **Backup Prepare Node** job and check if the **Instances** dropdown is set to `1`.
<%= image_tag("backup-prepare-node.png") %>

1. If the **Instances** dropdown is not set to `1`:
  1. Set the **Instances** dropdown to **1**.
  1. Click **Save**.
  1. Navigate back to the Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to redeploy.

### <a id='identify-deployment'></a> Step 7: Identify Your Deployment

1. Log in to your BOSH Director.  

1. To identify the name of the BOSH deployment that contains PCF, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE deployments
    ```
    Where:
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP retrieved in
    [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority 
      (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director. 

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE deployments

    Name                     Release(s)
    cf-example               push-apps-manager-release/661.1.24
                             cf-backup-and-restore/0.0.1
                             binary-buildpack/1.0.11
                             capi/1.28.0
                             cf-autoscaling/91
                             cf-mysql/35
                             ...
    </pre>

    In the above example, the name of the BOSH deployment that contains PCF is `cf-example`.

### <a id='check'></a> Step 8: Check Your Deployment

Perform the following steps to check that your BOSH Director is reachable and has a deployment that can be backed up:

1. Run the BBR pre-backup check:

    ```
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    pre-backup-check
  	```

    Where:
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP retrieved in
    [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**, identity and password, that you retrieved in 
    [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name retrieved in 
    [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority
    (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director.
    For more information, see [Ensure BOSH Director Certificate Availability](./system-setup-bbr.html#root-ca-cert).

1. After the pre-backup check succeeds, continue to [Create Your Backup](#procedure) below.  
<br>
If the pre-backup check fails, the deployment you selected might not have the correct backup scripts, or
the connection to the BOSH Director might have failed.

## <a id='procedure'></a> Creating Your Backup

### <a id='export'></a> Step 9: Export Installation Settings

Pivotal recommends that you back up your Ops Manager installation settings by exporting frequently.

When exporting your installation settings, keep in mind the following:

- This option is only available after you have deployed at least once.

- Always export your installation settings before following the steps in the
[Deploy Ops Manager and Import Installation Settings](./restore-pcf-bbr.html#deploy-import)
section of the _Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR_ topic.

- Exporting your installation settings only backs up the settings you configured in Ops Manager.
It does not back up your VMs or any external MySQL databases.

- Your Ops Manager settings are encrypted. Make sure you keep track of your
Decryption Passphrase because this is needed to restore the Ops Manager settings.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  When exporting installation settings for Ops Manager v1.12 and later, releases
  are not included in the output file.
  Releases are now included in the BOSH Director backup, therefore, the output file is
  much smaller than in previous Ops Manager versions.
</p>

There are two ways to export Ops Manager installation settings:

- [Use the Ops Manager UI](#export-using-ui)
- [Use the Ops Manager API](#export-using-api)

#### <a id='export-using-ui'></a>Option 1: Use the Ops Manager UI

To export your installation settings using the Ops Manager UI, do the following:

1. From the **Installation Dashboard** in the Ops Manager interface, click your
username at the top right navigation.

1. Select **Settings**.

1. Select **Export Installation Settings**.

1. Click **Export Installation Settings**.
    <%= image_tag("settings.png") %>

#### <a id='export-using-api'></a> Option 2: Use the Ops Manager API

If you want to automate the back up process, you can use the Ops Manager API to
export your installation settings.

1. To export your installation settings using the Ops Manager API, run the following command:

    ```
    curl https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/installation_asset_collection \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" > installation.zip
    ```

    Where:  
    * `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.  
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token. For more information, see [Access the
    API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html#access-api). 

### <a id='bbr-backup-director'></a> Step 10: Back Up Your BOSH Director

<div class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The BOSH Director backup can take more than 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Because the BBR <code>backup</code> command can take a long time to complete, Pivotal recommends you run it independently of the SSH session so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails.<br>Use <code>nohup</code>, a <code>screen</code>, or a <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

1. Run the BBR `backup` command to back up your BOSH Director:

    ```
    bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    --username bbr \
    --host HOST \
    backup
    ```

    Where:
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from 
    **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director:
      * If the BOSH Director is public, `HOST` is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`.
      * If the BOSH Director is not public, `HOST` is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` retrieved in
    [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
  
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Use the optional <code>--debug</code> flag to enable debug logs. See the <a href="#logging">Logging</a> section of this topic for more information.</p>

If your backup terminates early or fails you will need to perform a clean up.  

1. To clean up, run the following `backup-cleanup` command:

    ```
    bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    --username bbr \
    --host HOST \
    backup-cleanup
    ```

    Where:
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from 
    **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director:
      * If the BOSH Director is public, `HOST` is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`.
      * If the BOSH Director is not public, `HOST` is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` retrieved in
      [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).

### <a id='bbr-backup'></a> Step 11: Back Up Your PAS Deployment

<div class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Backing up PAS can take more than 5 minutes, and can take considerably longer with larger blobstores or slow network connections. The backup also incurs Cloud Controller downtime during which users are unable to push, scale, or delete apps. Your apps will not be affected.</li>
    <li>Because the BBR <code>backup</code> command can take a long time to complete, Pivotal recommends you run it independently of the SSH session, so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code> but you could also run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

1. (Optional) If you are not using an internal blobstore or a versioned S3-compatible external blobstore, create a copy of the blobstore with your IaaS specific tool. 
Your blobstore backup might be slightly inconsistent with your PAS backup depending on the duration of time between performing the backups.

1. Run the BBR `backup` command to back up your PAS deployment:

    ```
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    backup
    ```
    Where:
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP retrieved in
    [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**, identity and password, that you retrieved in 
    [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name retrieved in 
    [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority
      (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director.
    * Use the optional `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
    see [Logging](#logging) below.
    * Use the optional `--with-manifest` flag to ensure that BBR downloads your
    current deployment manifest when backing up.
    These manifests are included in the Ops Manager export, but are useful for reference.

1. After the command successfully completes, continue to [Step 11: Transfer Backup Artifacts](#transfer-artifacts).  
<br>
If the command fails, perform the following steps:  

  1. Run the BBR `backup-cleanup` command:

        ```
        bbr deployment \
        --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
        --username BOSH-CLIENT \
        --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
        --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
        --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
        backup-cleanup
        ```
        Where:
        * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP retrieved in
        [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
        * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**, identity and password, that you retrieved in 
        [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).    
        * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name retrieved in 
        [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
        * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority 
          (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director. 
        * Use the optional `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
        see [Logging](#logging) below.
        * Use the optional `--with-manifest` flag to ensure that BBR downloads your 
        current deployment manifest when backing up.
        These manifests are included in the Ops Manager export, but are useful for reference.

  1. Run the BBR `backup` command again after checking the following:
  <br>
      * All the parameters in the command are set.
      * The BOSH Director credentials are valid.
      * The specified deployment exists.


## <a id='after'></a> After Taking Your Backup

### <a id='transfer-artifacts'></a> Step 12: Transfer Backup Artifacts

After creating your backup successfully, perform the following steps:

1. Move the backup artifacts off the jumpbox to your preferred storage space. The backup created by BBR consists of a folder with the backup artifacts and metadata files. Pivotal recommends compressing and encrypting the files.

1. Make redundant copies of your backup artifacts and store them in multiple locations to minimize the risk of losing backups in the event of a disaster.

1. Attempt to restore every backup to validate the artifacts. Perform the procedures in the next step, [Step 12: Validate Your Backup](#validate-backup).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Backup artifacts might contain data covered by the <a href="#gdpr">European Union's <em>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em></a>.</p>

### <a id='validate-backup'></a> Step 13: (Optional) Validate Your Backup

After backing up PCF, consider validating your backup by restoring it and checking the applications. 
BBR is designed for disaster recovery and BBR backups are only compatible 
with environments matching their source environment's configuration. 

<div class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The VMs and disks from the backed-up BOSH Director must not be visible to the new BOSH Director</strong> when validating your backup. 
    As a result, Pivotal recommends that you deploy the new BOSH Director to a different IaaS network and account than the VMs and disks of the backed-up BOSH Director.</li>
    <li><strong>Data services outside of PCF might produce unexpected side effects during restoration.</strong> 
    Restored apps and services might attempt to connect to data services when you restore to a new environment. For example, 
consider an app that processes mail queues and connects to an external database. When you validate your backup in a test environment, 
the app might start processing the queue, and this work might be lost.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### <a id='full-validate'></a> Validate Your Backup in a Second Environment

To spin up a second environment and test the backup, perform the following steps:

1. Export your Ops Manager installation by performing the steps in the [Step 8: Export Installation Settings](#export) section above.

1. Create a new Ops Manager VM in a different network to the original. 
Ensure that the Ops Manager VM has enough persistent disk to accommodate the files exported in the previous step. 
Consult the topic specific to your IaaS:
  * [Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to AWS](../aws-terraform.html)
	* [Configuring AWS for PCF](../pcf-aws-manual-config.html)
    * [[Deploying Ops Manager on GCP Manually](../gcp-om-deploy.html)
    * [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](../openstack-setup.html)
    * [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](../deploying-vm.html)

1. Ensure that the restore environment is compatible with the backup. For more information, see [Compatibility of Restore](./restore-pcf-bbr.html#compatibility).

1. Follow the instructions in the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

#### <a id='ert-validate'></a> Validate Your PAS Backup Only

For a sandbox or other non-production environment, you can optionally perform an _in-place_ restore of PAS only. 
In this case, you restore the PAS backup to the same PCF environment that the backup was created from. 
Follow the procedures in [Restoring PCF from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-ert).

## <a id='logging'></a> Logging

BBR outputs logs to stdout. By default, BBR logs:

* The backup and restore scripts that it finds
* When it starts or finishes a stage, such as pre-backup scripts or backup scripts
* When the process is complete
* When any error occurs

If you require additional logging, use the optional `--debug` flag to print the following information:

* Logs about the API requests made to the BOSH server
* All commands executed on remote instances
* All commands executed on local environment
* Standard in and standard out streams for the backup and restore scripts when they are executed


## <a id='canceling-backup'></a> Cancel a Backup

If you need to cancel a backup, perform the following steps:

1. Enter `CTRL-C` to terminate the BBR process, then enter `yes` to confirm.

1. Run the BBR `backup-cleanup` command.
    * For a canceled director backup, run the following:

        ```
        bbr director \
        --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
        --username bbr \
        --host HOST \
        backup-cleanup
        ```
        Where:
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from 
    **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
        * `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director:
          * If the BOSH Director is public, `HOST` is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`.
          * If the BOSH Director is not public, `HOST` is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` retrieved in
          [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * For a canceled deployment backup, run the following:

        ```
        bbr deployment \
        --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
        --username BOSH-CLIENT \
        --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
        --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
        --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
        backup-cleanup
        ```
        Where:
        * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP retrieved in
        [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
        * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**, identity and password, that you retrieved in 
        [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
        * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name retrieved in 
        [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
        * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority 
          (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director. 
        * Use the optional `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
        see [Logging](#logging) below.
        * Use the optional `--with-manifest` flag to ensure that BBR downloads your 
        current deployment manifest when backing up.
        These manifests are included in the Ops Manager export, but are useful for reference.

## <a id="gdpr"></a> European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Backup artifacts might contain personal and other data covered by the European Union's _General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)_. 
For example, a PAS backup could contain user email addresses. As such, handle backup artifacts in accordance with organizational policies 
and applicable laws as they pertain to security, confidentiality, and privacy.
