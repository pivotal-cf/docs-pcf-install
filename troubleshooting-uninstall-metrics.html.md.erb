The Pivotal Ops Metrics tool is a JMX extension for Elastic Runtime.
Pivotal Ops Metrics collects and exposes system data from Cloud Foundry components via a JMX endpoint.
Use this system data to monitor your installation and assist in troubleshooting.

The Pivotal Ops Metrics tool is composed of the following three virtual machines:

- The JMX Provider
- A VM that governs compilation
- A nozzle for the [Loggregator Firehose](../loggregator/architecture.html)
