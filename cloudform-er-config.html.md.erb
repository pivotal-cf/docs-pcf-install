This topic describes how to install and configure Elastic Runtime after
deploying the CloudFormation template for [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Use this topic when [installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on AWS](./cloudform.html).

Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all
steps in the [Deploying the CloudFormation Template for PCF on AWS](./cloudform-template.html) and [Configuring Ops Manager Director after Deploying PCF on AWS using CloudFormation](./cloudform-om-config.html) topics.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you plan to <a href = "http://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html">install the PCF IPsec add-on</a>, you must do so before installing any other tiles. Pivotal recommends installing IPsec immediately after Ops Manager, and before installing the Elastic Runtime tile.</p>

## <a id='open-outputs'></a>Step 1: Open the Outputs Tab in AWS ##

<%= partial 'aws_stacks_view_outputs' %>

## <a id='add-er'></a>Step 2: Add Elastic Runtime to Ops Manager ##

1. Navigate to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager Installation
Dashboard.

1. If you have not downloaded Elastic Runtime, click the Pivotal Network link on the left to download the Elastic Runtime .pivotal file. Click **Import a Product** to add the tile to Ops Manager. For more information, refer to the [Adding and Deleting Products](./add-delete.html) topic.

1. Click the **Elastic Runtime** tile in the Installation Dashboard.

    <%= image_tag("images/er-tile.png") %>

## <a id='assign-az'></a>Step 3: Assign Availability Zones and Networks ##

1. Select **Assign AZ and Networks**. These are the Availability Zones that you [create](../customizing/cloudform-om-config.html#az) when configuring Ops Manager Director.

1. Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**. Ops Manager runs any job with a single instance in this Availability Zone.

1. Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**. Ops Manager balances instances of jobs with more than one instance across the Availability Zones that you specify.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends at least three Availability Zones for a highly available installation of Elastic Runtime.</p>

1. From the **Network** drop-down box, choose the network on which you want to run Elastic Runtime.
	<%= image_tag("er-az.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you save this form, a verification error displays because the PCF security group blocks ICMP. You can ignore this error.</p>
    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er-network-error.png") %>

## <a id='cname'></a>Step 4: Add CNAME Record for Your Custom Domain ##

In the [Use the AWS CLI to upload your SSL Cert](./cloudform-template.html#upload-cert) step, you uploaded an SSL certificate for your PCF wildcard domain to AWS.
In this step you redirect all wildcard queries for your domain to the DNS name of your ELB.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Do not point your wildcard domain at the numeric IP address for your ELB because this changes frequently.</p>

1. Find the DNS hostname of your ELB. The **Output** tab of the CloudFormation page in the AWS dashboard lists this as the value for the key **PcfElbDnsName**.

1. Log in to the DNS registrar that hosts your domain (for example, Network Solutions, GoDaddy, or Register.com).

1. Create a CNAME record with your DNS registrar that points `*.YOUR-DOMAIN.com` to the DNS hostname of your ELB.

1. Save changes within the web interface of your DNS registrar.

1. In the terminal, run the following `dig` command to confirm that you created your CNAME record successfully:

    <pre class='terminal'>dig xyz.MY-DOMAIN.COM</pre>

    You should see the CNAME record that you just created:
    <pre class='terminal'>
;; ANSWER SECTION:
xyz.MY-DOMAIN.COM.      1767    IN  CNAME pcf-ert-frankfurt-pcf-elb-428333773.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com.</pre>

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: You <strong>must</strong> complete this step before proceeding to Cloud Controller configuration. A problem that is difficult to resolve can occur if the wildcard domain is improperly cached before the CNAME is registered. </p>

## <a id='er-domain-config'></a>Step 5: Configure Domains ##

1. Select **Domains**.

    <%= image_tag("domains.png") %>

1. Enter the system and application domains.
    * The **System Domain** defines your target when you push apps to Elastic
      Runtime.
    * The **Apps Domain** defines where Elastic Runtime should serve your apps.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends that you use the same domain name but different subdomain names for your system and app domains. This prevents system and apps routes from overlapping. You will require two wildcard DNS entries: one for the system and the other for apps. For example,  <code>*.system.EXAMPLE.COM</code> and <code>*.apps.EXAMPLE.COM</code>. Point both wildcard domains at your internal router IP address, which you can find under the status tab in the Elastic Runtime tile.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You configured a wildcard DNS record
    for these domains in an earlier step.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id="networking"></a>Step 6: Configure Networking ##

<%= partial 'networking-cloudform' %>

## <a id='application-containers-config'></a>Step 7: Configure Application Containers ##

<%= partial 'application_container_config' %>

## <a id='er-appdevctrl-config'></a>Step 8: Configure Application Developer Controls ##

1. Select **Application Developer Controls**.

    <%= image_tag("er17-config-appdevctrl.png") %>

1. Enter your intended maximum file upload size.

1. Enter your default RAM memory allocation per app.

1. Enter your default total RAM memory (RAM) quota per Org. You can change this in the CLI.

1. Enter your maximum and default disk quotas per app.

1. Enter your default service instances quota per Org. You can change this in the CLI.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='app-security'></a>Step 9: Review Application Security Groups ##

<%= partial 'application_security_group' %>

## <a id='er-auth-config'></a>Step 10: Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO ##

<%= partial 'authsso_config' %>

## <a id='create-dbs'></a>Step 11: Create System Databases ##

You can configure Elastic Runtime to use the internal MySQL database provided with PCF, or you can configure an external database provider for the databases required by Elastic Runtime.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are performing an upgrade, do not modify your existing internal database configuration or you may lose data. You must migrate your existing data first before changing the configuration. See <a href="upgrading-pcf.html">Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> for additional upgrade information.</p>

###<a id='internal-db'></a> Internal Database Configuration

<%= partial 'ert_database_internal' %>

Then proceed to [Step 12: (Optional) Configure Internal MySQL](#internal-mysql) to configure high availability and automatic backups for your internal MySQL databases.

### <a id='create-dbs'></a> Create External System Databases ###

If you want to use an external database provider for your Elastic Runtime databases, you must first create the databases on the RDS instance provided by the CloudFormation script.

To create the required databases on an AWS RDS instance, perform the following steps.

1. Add the AWS-provided key pair to your SSH profile so that you can access the Ops Manager VM:

    <pre class='terminal'>ssh-add aws-keypair.pem</pre>

1. SSH into your Ops Manager using the [Ops Manager FQDN](../customizing/cloudform-om-deploy.html#create-dns) and the username `ubuntu`:

    <pre class='terminal'>ssh ubuntu@OPS_MANAGER_FQDN</pre>

1. Run the following terminal command to log in to your RDS instance through the MySQL client, using values from your AWS dashboard [**Outputs**](#open-outputs) tab to fill in the following output keys:

     <pre class='terminal'>mysql --host=PcfRdsAddress --user=PcfRdsUsername --password=PcfRdsPassword</pre>

1. Run the following MySQL commands to create databases for the seven Elastic Runtime components that require a relational database:
  <pre class="terminal">CREATE database uaa;
  CREATE database ccdb;
  CREATE database notifications;
  CREATE database autoscale;
  CREATE database app\_usage\_service;
  CREATE database console;</pre>
  <p class="note">The `console` database is deprecated but must be created to complete the installation procedure. After successfully deploying PCF v1.8, you can manually drop this database from the MySQL server. If you keep the database, you no longer need to backup and restore it. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#consoledeprecation">Pivotal Elastic Runtime v1.8 Release Notes</a>.</p>

1. Type `exit` to quit the MySQL client and `exit` again to close your connection to the Ops Manager VM.

## <a id='sys-db'></a>Step 12: Configure System Databases ##
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are performing an upgrade, do not modify your existing internal database configuration or you may lose data. You must migrate your existing data first before changing the configuration. See <a href="upgrading-pcf.html">Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> for additional upgrade information.</p>
1. Select **Databases**.

1. Select the **External Databases** option.

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/sys-db.png") %>

1. Complete the fields with information from the corresponding [**Outputs** tab](#open-outputs) in the AWS Console, according to the following table:
  <table border="1" class="nice" >
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Elastic Runtime Field</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Outputs Key</strong></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><str>Hostname DNS Name</str></td>
      <td><str>PcfRdsAddress</str></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><str>TCP Port</str></td>
      <td><str>PcfRdsPort</str></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><str>Password</str></td>
      <td><str>PcfRdsPassword</str></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='internal-mysql'></a> Step 13: (Optional) Configure Internal MySQL ##

<%= partial 'mysql_proxy_config' %>

## <a id='filestore'></a>Step 14: Configure File Storage ##

1. In the Elastic Runtime tile, select **File Storage**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends using a highly resilient and redundant filestore that is S3 compatible. This minimizes downtime of system operability, which includes running <code>cf-push</code>.</p>

1. To use the PCF internal filestore, select **Internal WebDAV** and click **Save**.

1. To use an external S3-compatible filestore for your Elastic
Runtime file storage, select the **External S3-Compatible Filestore** option and complete the
following fields:

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/external_filestore_config.png") %>
    * For **URL Endpoint**:
        1. In a browser, open the [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) table](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region).
        1. Prepend `https://` to the **Endpoint** for your region and copy it
          into the Ops Manager **URL Endpoint** field.
		      <br />
		      For example, in the **us-west-2** region, use
		      `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/`.
    * For **S3 Signature Version** and **Region**, keep the default **V2 Signature** values unless your S3 filestore is in Germany or China. These regions require a **V4 Signature**.
    * Select **Server-side Encryption (available for AWS S3 only)** to encrypt the contents of your S3 filestore. See the [AWS S3 documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html) for more information.
    * Use the values in your AWS [**Outputs**](#open-outputs) tab to complete the remaining fields as follows:
    <table border="1" class="nice" >
      <tr>
        <th>Ops Manager Field</th>
        <th>Outputs Key</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Buildpacks Bucket Name</td>
        <td>PcfElasticRuntimeS3BuildpacksBucket</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Droplets Bucket Name</td>
        <td>PcfElasticRuntimeS3DropletsBucket</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Packages Bucket Name</td>
        <td>PcfElasticRuntimeS3PackagesBucket</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Resources Bucket Name</td>
        <td>PcfElasticRuntimeS3ResourcesBucket</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Access Key ID</td>
        <td>PcfIamUserAccessKey</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>AWS Secret Key</td>
        <td>PcfIamUserSecretAccessKey</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='sys-logging'></a>Step 15: (Optional) Configure System Logging ##

If you are forwarding logging messages to an external Reliable Event Logging Protocol (RELP) server, complete the following steps:

1. Select **System Logging**.
  <%= image_tag("cloudform/sys-logging.png") %>
1. If you want to include security events in your log stream, select the **Enable Cloud Controller security event logging** checkbox. This logs all API requests, including the endpoint, user, source IP, and request result, in the Common Event Format (CEF).
1. Enter the IP address of your syslog server in **External Syslog Aggregator Hostname** and its port in **External Syslog Aggregator Port**. The default port for a syslog server is `514`.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The host must be reachable from the Elastic Runtime network, accept TCP connections, and use the RELP protocol. Ensure your syslog server listens on external interfaces.</p>

1. Select an **External Syslog Network Protocol** to use when forwarding logs.

1. For the **Syslog Drain Buffer Size**, enter the number of messages the Doppler server can hold from Metron agents before the server starts to drop them. See the [Loggregator Guide for Cloud Foundry Operators](../loggregator/log-ops-guide.html) topic for more details.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='customize-apps-man'></a>Step 16: (Optional) Customize Apps Manager##

<%= partial 'custombranding' %>

## <a id='smtp'></a>Step 17: (Optional) Configure Email Notifications ##

Elastic Runtime uses SMTP to send invitations and confirmations to Apps Manager
users.
You must complete the **Email Notifications** page if you want to enable
end-user self-registration.

1. Select **Email Notifications**.

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/smtp.png") %>

1. Enter your reply-to and SMTP email information.

1. For **SMTP Authentication Mechanism**, select `none`.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not configure the SMTP
settings using this form, the administrator must create orgs and users using
the cf CLI tool. See <a href="../adminguide/cli-user-management.html">Creating and Managing Users with the cf CLI</a> for more information.</p>

## <a id='ccdb-key'></a>Step 18: (Optional) Add CCDB Restore Key##

<%= partial 'restore_ccdb_key' %>

## <a id='config-smoke-test'></a>Step 19: Configure Smoke Tests##

<%= partial '_smoketests' %>

## <a id='advanced-features'></a>Step 20: (Optional) Enable Advanced Features ##

Use caution when enabling advanced features if you have other Pivotal Cloud Foundry service tiles installed in your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment. Not all of the services are guaranteed to work as expected with these features enabled.

### <a id="disk-memory-overcommit"></a>Diego Cell Memory and Disk Overcommit

If your apps do not use the full allocation of disk space and memory set in the **Resource Config** tab, you might want use this feature. These fields control the amount to overcommit disk and memory resources to each Diego Cell VM.

For example, you might want to use the overcommit if your apps use a small amount of disk and memory capacity compared with the **Resource Config** settings for **Diego Cell**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Due to the risk of app failure and the deployment-specific nature of disk and memory use, Pivotal has no recommendation about how much, if any, memory or disk space to overcommit.</p>

To enable overcommit, follow these steps:

1. Select **Advanced Features**.

    <%= image_tag("./disk-memory-overcommit.png") %>

1. Enter the total desired amount of Diego cell memory value in the **Cell Memory Capacity (MB)** field. Refer to the **Diego Cell** row in the **Resource Config** tab for the current Cell memory capacity settings that this field overrides.

1. Enter the total desired amount of Diego cell disk capacity value in the **Cell Disk Capacity (MB)** field. Refer to the **Diego Cell** row in the **Resource Config** tab for the current Cell disk capacity settings that this field overrides.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Entries made to each of these two fields set the total amount of resources allocated, not the overage.</p>

### <a id="disable-priviledge"></a> Disable Privileged App Containers

By default, Pivotal Cloud Foundry deploys apps in privileged containers. Apps deployed to privileged containers can gain access to their host operating system. In general, Pivotal recommends disabling privileged containers by selecting this option.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Do not select <strong>Disable privileged app containers</strong> if you are running applications that use FUSE file system support. </p>

To disable privileged app containers, follow these steps:

1. Select **Advanced Features**.

    <%= image_tag("./disk-memory-overcommit.png") %>

1. Select **Disable privileged app containers**. This setting only applies to newly pushed apps, so you must restart any pre-existing apps to apply this option.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Containers based on Docker images are always unprivileged, regardless of this setting.</p>

### <a id="enable-tcp"></a>Enable TCP Routing

TCP Routing is available for users who want an alternative to HTTP. For more information, including details about setting up your networking infrastructure for TCP Routing, see [Enabling TCP Routing](../adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html). 

1. TCP Routing is disabled by default. To enable this feature, select the **Enable TCP Routing** radio button. 

    <%= image_tag("./tcp_routing.png") %>

1. You do not need to enter **TCP Router IPs** if you are using an ELB. Instead, navigate to <strong>Resource Config</strong> and, in the **TCP Router** job, enter your ELB name in the **ELB Names** column. See [Step 22: Configure Router to Elastic Load Balancer](#config-elb) for more information.

1. In **TCP Routing Ports**, enter the range of ports you reserved for TCP routes. These ports must be available on your load balancer. You can specify a list of ports with commas between each port number and specify ranges of ports with dashes between the first and last port number. This configuration only applies the first time you specify it here. If you later want to update the ports, see the [HTTP vs TCP Routes](../devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#http-vs-tcp-routes) topic on how to use the cf CLI to update TCP Routing ports.

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="disable-tcp"></a>Disable TCP Routing

1. If you want to disable TCP routing after enabling it, click **Select this option if you prefer to enable TCP Routing at a later time**.

1. Manually remove the TCP routing domain. 

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="rfc_whitelist"></a>Whitelist for Non-RFC-1918 Private Networks

Some private networks require extra configuration so that internal filestore (WebDAV) can communicate with other PCF processes. 

The **Whitelist for non-RFC-1918 Private Networks** field is provided for deployments that use a non-RFC 1918 private network. This is typically a private network other than `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`. 

Most PCF deployments do not require any modifications to this field.

To add your private network to the whitelist, perform the following steps:

1. Select **Advanced Features**.

1. Append a new `allow` rule to the existing contents of the **Whitelist for non-RFC-1918 Private Networks** field. 
  <%= image_tag("./nonrfc_whitelist.png") %>
  Include the word `allow`, the network CIDR range to allow, and a semi-colon (`;`) at the end. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
  allow 172.99.0.0/24;
  </pre>
   
1. Click **Save**.
