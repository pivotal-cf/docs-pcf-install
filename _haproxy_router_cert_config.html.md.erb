Under **Certificates and Private Key for HAProxy and Router**, you must provide at least one **Certificate and Private Key** name and certificate key pair for HAProxy and Gorouter. HAProxy and Gorouter are enabled to receive TLS communication by default. You can configure multiple certificates for HAProxy and Gorouter.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When providing custom certificates, enter them in the following order: <code>wildcard</code>, <code>Intermediate</code>, <code>CA</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://www.digicert.com/ssl-support/pem-ssl-creation.htm">Creating a .pem File for SSL Certificate Installations</a> in the DigiCert documentation.</p>
  1. Click **Add** to add a name for the certificate chain and its private key pair. This certificate is the default used by Gorouter and HAProxy.
   You can either provide a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) or click on the **Generate RSA Certificate** link to generate a certificate generated by the Ops Manager CA.
  	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you configured Ops Manager Front End without a certificate, you can use this new certificate to complete Ops Manager configuration. To configure your Ops Manager Front End certificate, see _Configure Front End_ in <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#config-frontend">Preparing to Deploy Ops Manager on GCP Manually</a>.</p>
  1. If you want to configure multiple certificates for HAProxy and Gorouter, click **Add** and fill in the appropriate fields for each additional certificate key pair.
  For details about generating certificates in Ops Manager for your wildcard system domains, see the <a href="../opsguide/security_config.html#config">Providing a Certificate for Your SSL/TLS Termination Point</a> topic.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that you add any certificates that you generate in this pane to your infrastructure load balancer.</p>
