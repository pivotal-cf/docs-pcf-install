<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

To perform advanced troubleshooting, you must log in to the BOSH Director. 

After authenticating into the BOSH Director, you can run specific commands using the BOSH Command Line Interface (BOSH CLI). BOSH Director diagnostic commands have access to information about your entire [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) installation.

The BOSH Director runs on the virtual machine (VM) that Ops Manager deploys on the first install of the Ops Manager Director tile.

BOSH Director diagnostic commands have access to information about your entire
[Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf)
(PCF) installation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For more troubleshooting information, refer to the <a href="./troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting Guide</a>.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Verify that no BOSH Director tasks are running on the Ops Manager VM before running any commands.
See the <i>Tasks</i> section of the <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2#task-mgmt">BOSH CLI commands</a> for more information.</p>

## <a id='about'></a>About the BOSH CLI ##

The BOSH CLI is available in two major versions, v1 and v2. You can use either BOSH CLI, but Pivotal recommends that you use the BOSH CLI v2 since v1 will be deprecated. BOSH CLI v2 is installed on Ops Manager as `/usr/local/bin/bosh2`.

Ops Manager includes both versions for backwards compatibility purposes. Any manifests that have been generated using BOSH v2 cannot be deployed with the BOSH v1 CLI.

This topic provides examples of using each version of the BOSH CLI.

## <a id='gather'></a>Gather Credential and IP Address Information ##

Before you begin troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI, follow the instructions below to collect the information you need from the Ops Manager interface.

1. Open the Ops Manager interface by navigating to the Ops Manager fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in a web browser. 

1. Click the **Ops Manager Director** tile and select the **Status** tab.

1. Record the IP address for the Director job. This is the IP
address of the VM where the BOSH Director runs.

	<%= image_tag("ops-mgr-job-ip.png") %>

1. Select the **Credentials** tab.

1. Click **Link to Credential** to view and record the **Director Credentials**.

    <%= image_tag("bosh-creds.png") %>

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. **(Optional)** To prepare to troubleshoot the job VM for any other product,
click the product tile and repeat the procedure above to record the IP address
and VM credentials for that job VM.

1. Log out of Ops Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure that there are no Ops Manager installations or updates in progress while using the BOSH CLI.</p>

## <a id='ssh'></a>SSH into Ops Manager ##

Use SSH to connect to the Ops Manager web application VM.

Follow the instructions in one of the sections below to SSH into the Ops Manager VM.

**vSphere:**

You need the credentials used to import the PCF .ova or .ovf file into
your virtualization system.

1. From a command line, run `ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` to SSH into the Ops Manager VM. Replace `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` with the fully qualified domain name of Ops Manager.

1. When prompted, enter the password that you set during the .ova deployment
into vCenter. For example:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ ssh ubuntu@my-opsmanager-fqdn.example.com
    Password: ***********
    </pre>

**AWS, Azure, and OpenStack:**

1. Locate the Ops Manager FQDN on the AWS **EC2 instances** page or the OpenStack **Access & Security** page.

1. Run `chmod 600 ops_mgr.pem` to change the permissions on the `.pem` file to be more restrictive:

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ chmod 600 ops_mgr.pem
	</pre>

1. Run `ssh -i ops_mgr.pem ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` to SSH into the Ops Manager VM. Replace `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` with the fully qualified domain name of Ops Manager. For example:

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ ssh -i ops_mgr.pem ubuntu@my-opsmanager-fqdn.example.com
	</pre>

**GCP:**

1. Confirm that you have installed the gcloud CLI. If you do not have the gcloud CLI, see [the Google Cloud Platform documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/#downloading_gcloud).

1. Run `gcloud config set project MY-PROJECT` to configure your Google Cloud Platform project. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ gcloud config set project gcp
    </pre>

1. Run `gcloud auth login MY-GCP-ACCOUNT`. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ gcloud auth login user<span>@</span>example.com
    </pre>

1. Run `gcloud compute ssh MY-INSTANCE --zone MY-ZONE`. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ gcloud compute ssh om-pcf-1a --zone us-central1-b
    </pre>

1. Run `sudo su ubuntu`.

### <a id='product'></a>Select a Product Deployment to Troubleshoot ###

When you import and install a product using Ops Manager, you deploy an instance
of the product described by a YAML file. Examples of available products include
Elastic Runtime, MySQL, or any other service that you imported and installed.

Perform the following steps to select a product deployment to troubleshoot:

1. Identify the YAML file that describes the deployment you want to
troubleshoot.

    You identify the YAML file that describes a deployment by its filename.
    For example, to identify Elastic Runtime deployments, run the following
    command:

    `find /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments -name cf-*.yml`

    The table below shows the naming conventions for deployment files.

    <table border="1" class="nice" >
      <tr>
        <th>Product</th><th>Deployment Filename Convention</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Elastic Runtime</td>
        <td>cf-&lt;20-character_random_string&gt;.yml</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>MySQL Dev</td>
        <td>cf_services-&lt;20-character_random_string&gt;.yml</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Other</td>
        <td>&lt;20-character_random_string&gt;.yml</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Where there is more than one installation of the same product, record the release number shown on the product tile in Operations Manager. Then, from the YAML files for that product, find the deployment that specifies the same release version as the product tile.</p>

1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENV environment`, replacing `MY-ENV` with the alias you set for the BOSH Director. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e gcp environment</pre>
    The output of the command includes the BOSH Director UUID. Record the UUID value.

1. Open the `DEPLOYMENT-FILENAME.yml` file in a text editor and compare the
`director_uuids` value in this file with the UUID value that you recorded.
If the values do not match, replace the `director_uuids` value with the UUID value that you recorded before continuing to the next step.

1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT deploy DEPLOYMENT-FILENAME.yml` to reset the file for your deployment. Replace the placeholder text as follows:
    * `MY-ENV`: Enter the alias you set for the BOSH Director.
    * `MY-DEPLOYMENT`: Enter the name of the deployment you are troubleshooting.
    * `DEPLOYMENT-FILENAME`: Enter the manifest file for the deployment you are troubleshooting.

    For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh -e gcp -d cf deploy /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/cf-cca1234abcd.yml
    </pre>

## <a id='cli'></a>Use the BOSH CLI for Troubleshooting

This section describes three BOSH CLI commands commonly used during
troubleshooting.

* **VMs**: Lists all VMs in a deployment
* **Cloud Check**: Runs a cloud consistency check and interactive repair
* **SSH**: Starts an interactive session or executes commands with a VM

### <a id='vms'></a>BOSH VMs

The `bosh vms` command provides an overview of the virtual machines that BOSH manages.
To use the `bosh vms` command, run `bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT vms`. Replace `MY-ENV` with your environment, and `MY-DEPLOYMENT` with a deployment. `-d MY-DEPLOYMENT` is optional.

When troubleshooting an issue with your deployment, `bosh vms` may show a VM in
an **unknown** state.
Run [bosh cloud-check](#cck) on a VM in an **unknown** state to instruct BOSH to
diagnose problems with the VM.

You can also run `bosh vms` to identify VMs in your deployment, then use the
[bosh ssh](#ssh) command to SSH into an identified VM for further 
troubleshooting.

`bosh vms` supports the following arguments:

* `--dns`: Report also includes the DNS A record for each VM
* `--vitals`: Report also includes load, CPU, memory usage, swap usage, system disk usage, ephemeral disk usage, and persistent disk usage for each VM

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Status</strong> tab of the <strong>Elastic Runtime</strong> product tile displays information similar to the <code>bosh vms</code> output.</p>

### <a id='cck'></a>BOSH Cloud Check

Run the `bosh cloud-check` command to instruct BOSH to detect differences
between the VM state database maintained by the BOSH Director and the actual
state of the VMs. For each difference detected, `bosh cloud-check` can offer the
following repair options:

* `Reboot VM`: Instructs BOSH to reboot a VM. Rebooting can resolve many
  transient errors.
* `Ignore problem`: Instructs BOSH to do nothing.
  You may want to ignore a problem in order to run `bosh ssh` and attempt
  troubleshooting directly on the machine.
* `Reassociate VM with corresponding instance`: Updates the BOSH Director state
  database.
  Use this option if you believe that the BOSH Director state database is in
  error and that a VM is correctly associated with a job.
* `Recreate VM using last known apply spec`: Instructs BOSH to destroy the
  server and recreate it from the deployment manifest that the installer
  provides. Use this option if a VM is corrupted.
* `Delete VM reference`: Instructs BOSH to delete a VM reference in the
  Director state database. If a VM reference exists in the state database, BOSH
  expects to find an agent running on the VM.
  Select this option only if you know that this reference is in error.
  Once you delete the VM reference, BOSH can no longer control the VM.

To use the `bosh cloud-check` command, run `bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT cloud-check`.  Replace `MY-ENV` with your environment, and `MY-DEPLOYMENT` with your deployment. 

####Example Scenarios ####

### <a id='bosh-ssh'></a>BOSH SSH ###

Use `bosh ssh` to SSH into the VMs in your deployment.

Follows the steps below to use `bosh ssh`:

1. Run `ssh-keygen -t rsa` to provide BOSH with the correct public key.

1. Accept the defaults.

1. Run `bosh ssh`.

1. Select a VM to access.

1. Create a password for the temporary user that the `bosh ssh` command creates.
Use this password if you need sudo access in this session.

Example:

<pre class='terminal'>

### <a id='standard-ssh'></a>Standard SSH ###

In most cases, operators should use the `bosh ssh` command in the BOSH CLI to SSH into the BOSH Director and other VMs in their deployment. However, operators can also use standard `ssh` by performing the procedures below.

1. Locate the IP address of your BOSH Director and your BOSH Director credentials by following the [steps](#gather) above.
1. Run `ssh BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP -i PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY` to SSH into the BOSH Director with the private key you used with `bosh-init` to deploy the BOSH Director. Replace `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` with the IP address of the BOSH Director and `PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY` with the path to your private key.

1. Enter your BOSH Director credentials to log in.

From the BOSH Director, you can SSH into the other VMs in your deployment by performing the following steps:

1. Identify the private IP address of the component VM you want to SSH into by doing one of the following:
    * Perform the [steps](#prepare) above to use the BOSH CLI to log in to your BOSH Director and use `bosh vms` to [list](#vms) the IP addresses of your component VMs.
    * Navigate to your IaaS console and locate the IP address of the VM. For example, Amazon Web Services users can locate the IP addresses of component VMs in the VPC Dashboard of the AWS Console.
1. SSH into the component VM:
<pre class="terminal">$ ssh COMPONENT-VM-PRIVATE-IP</pre>
