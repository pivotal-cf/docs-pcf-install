<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes using the BOSH CLI to help diagnose and resolve issues with your [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) deployment. Before using the information and techniques in this topic, review [Diagnosing Problems in PCF](./diagnostics.html).

To follow the steps in this topic, you must log in to the BOSH Director. The BOSH Director runs on the virtual machine (VM) that Ops Manager deploys on the first install of the Ops Manager Director tile.

After authenticating into the BOSH Director, you can run specific commands using the BOSH Command Line Interface (BOSH CLI). BOSH Director diagnostic commands have access to information about your entire [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) installation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before running any BOSH CLI commands, verify that no BOSH Director tasks are running on the Ops Manager VM. See the <em>Tasks</em> section of <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2#task-mgmt">BOSH CLI commands</a> for more information.</p>

## <a id='gather'></a>Gather Credential and IP Address Information ##

Before you begin troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI, follow the instructions below to collect the information you need from the Ops Manager interface.

1. Open the Ops Manager interface by navigating to the Ops Manager fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in a web browser. 

1. Click the **Ops Manager Director** tile and select the **Status** tab.

1. Record the IP address for the Director job. This is the IP
address of the VM where the BOSH Director runs.

	<%= image_tag("ops-mgr-job-ip.png") %>

1. Select the **Credentials** tab.

1. Click **Link to Credential** to view the **Director Credentials**. Record these credentials.

    <%= image_tag("bosh-creds.png") %>

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. **(Optional)** To prepare to troubleshoot the job VM for any other product,
click the product tile and repeat the procedure above to record the IP address
and VM credentials for that job VM.

1. Log out of Ops Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure that there are no Ops Manager installations or updates in progress while using the BOSH CLI.</p>

## <a id='ssh'></a>SSH into Ops Manager ##

Use SSH to connect to the Ops Manager web application VM. Follow the instructions in one of the sections below to SSH into the Ops Manager VM.

**vSphere:**

To SSH into the Ops Manager VM in vSphere, you need the credentials used to import the PCF .ova or .ovf file into your virtualization system.

1. From a command line, run `ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` to SSH into the Ops Manager VM. Replace `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` with the fully qualified domain name of Ops Manager.

1. When prompted, enter the password that you set during the .ova deployment
into vCenter. For example:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ ssh ubuntu@my-opsmanager-fqdn.example.com
    Password: ***********
    </pre>

**AWS, Azure, and OpenStack:**

To SSH into the Ops Manager VM in AWS, Azure, and OpenStack, follow these instructions:

1. Locate the Ops Manager FQDN on the AWS **EC2 instances** page or the OpenStack **Access & Security** page.

1. Run `chmod 600 ops_mgr.pem` to change the permissions on the `.pem` file to be more restrictive. For example:

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ chmod 600 ops_mgr.pem
	</pre>

1. Run `ssh -i ops_mgr.pem ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` to SSH into the Ops Manager VM. Replace `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` with the fully qualified domain name of Ops Manager. For example:

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ ssh -i ops_mgr.pem ubuntu@my-opsmanager-fqdn.example.com
	</pre>

**GCP:**

To SSH into the Ops Manager VM in GCP, follow these instructions:

1. Confirm that you have installed the gcloud CLI. See the [Google Cloud Platform documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/#downloading_gcloud) for more information.

1. Run `gcloud config set project MY-PROJECT` to configure your Google Cloud Platform project. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ gcloud config set project gcp
    </pre>

1. Run `gcloud auth login MY-GCP-ACCOUNT`. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ gcloud auth login user<span>@</span>example.com
    </pre>

1. Run `gcloud compute ssh MY-INSTANCE --zone MY-ZONE`. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ gcloud compute ssh om-pcf-1a --zone us-central1-b
    </pre>

1. Run `sudo su - ubuntu` to switch to the `ubuntu` user.

## <a id='log-in'></a>Log in to the BOSH Director

Follow the steps below to log in to the BOSH Director.

### <a id='bosh-alias'></a>Create a Local BOSH Director Alias

1. Run the following command to create a local alias for the BOSH Director using the BOSH CLI: `bosh alias-env MY-ENV -e DIRECTOR-IP-ADDRESS --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate`

    Replace the placeholder text with the following:
    * `MY-ENV`: Enter an alias for the BOSH Director, such as `gcp`.
    * `DIRECTOR-IP-ADDRESS`: Enter the IP address of your Ops Manager Director VM.
For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh alias-env gcp -e 10.0.0.3 --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate</pre>

1. Log in to the BOSH Director using one of the following options:
  * [Internal User Store Login through UAA](#uaa-bosh): Log in to the Director using BOSH.
  * [External User Store Login through SAML](#saml-bosh): Use an external user store to log in to the BOSH Director.

### <a id='uaa-bosh'></a>Log in to the BOSH Director with UAA

1. Retrieve the Director password from the **Ops Manager Director > Credentials** tab. Alternatively, launch a browser and visit `https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/director_credentials` to obtain the password. Replace `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` with the fully qualified domain name of Ops Manager.

1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENV log-in` to log in to the BOSH Director. Replace `MY-ENV` with the alias for your BOSH Director. For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>$ bosh -e gcp log-in</pre>
    Follow the BOSH CLI prompts and enter the Ops Manager Director credentials to log in to the BOSH Director.

### <a id='saml-bosh'></a>Log in to the BOSH Director with SAML

1. Log in to your identity provider and use the following information to configure SAML Service Provider Properties:
  * **Service Provider Entity ID**: `bosh-uaa`
  * **ACS URL**: `https://DIRECTOR-IP-ADDRESS:8443/saml/SSO/alias/bosh-uaa`
  * **Binding**: HTTP Post
  * **SLO URL**: `https://DIRECTOR-IP-ADDRESS:8443/saml/SSO/alias/bosh-uaa`
  * **Binding**: HTTP Redirect
  * **Name ID**: Email Address

1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENV log-in` to log in to the BOSH Director. Replace `MY-ENV` with the alias for your BOSH Director. For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>$ bosh -e gcp log-in</pre>
    Follow the BOSH CLI prompts and enter your SAML credentials to log in to the BOSH Director.
    <br><br>
    If you do not have browser access to the BOSH Director, run `sshuttle` on a local Linux workstation to browse the BOSH Director IP address as if it were a local address. Retrieve a UAA passcode using the browser:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ git clone https:<span>//</span>github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle.git
    $ cd sshuttle
    $ ./sshuttle -r username@opsmanagerIP 0.0.0.0/0 -vv
    </pre>

1. Click **Log in with organization credentials (SAML)**.

    <%= image_tag("login-saml-credentials.png") %>

1. Copy the **Temporary Authentication Code** that appears in your browser.

    <%= image_tag("saml-login-temp-auth-code.png") %>

1. You see a login confirmation. For example:

    <pre class='terminal'>Logged in as admin@example.org
    </pre>

## <a id='cli'></a>Use the BOSH CLI for Troubleshooting

This section describes three BOSH CLI commands commonly used during
troubleshooting.

* **VMs**: Lists the VMs in a deployment
* **Cloud Check**: Runs a cloud consistency check and interactive repair
* **SSH**: Starts an interactive session or executes commands with a VM

### <a id='vms'></a>BOSH VMs

The `bosh vms` command provides an overview of the virtual machines that BOSH manages.

To use this command, run `bosh2 -e MY-ENV vms` to see an overview of all virtual machines managed by BOSH, or `bosh2 -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT vms` to see only the virtual machines associated with a particular deployment. Replace `MY-ENV` with your environment, and, if using the `-d` flag, also replace `MY-DEPLOYMENT` with the name of a deployment.

When troubleshooting an issue with your deployment, `bosh vms` may show a VM in
an **unknown** state.
Run [bosh <%= vars.bosh_cloud_check %>](#cck) on a VM in an **unknown** state to instruct BOSH to
diagnose problems with the VM.

You can also run `bosh vms` to identify VMs in your deployment, then use the
[bosh ssh](#ssh) command to SSH into an identified VM for further 
troubleshooting.

`bosh vms` supports the following arguments:

* `--dns`: Report also includes the DNS A record for each VM
* `--vitals`: Report also includes load, CPU, memory usage, swap usage, system disk usage, ephemeral disk usage, and persistent disk usage for each VM

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Status</strong> tab of the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) product tile displays information similar to the <code>bosh vms</code> output.</p>

### <a id='cck'></a>BOSH Cloud Check

Run the `bosh <%= vars.bosh_cloud_check %>` command to instruct BOSH to detect differences
between the VM state database maintained by the BOSH Director and the actual
state of the VMs. For each difference detected, `bosh <%= vars.bosh_cloud_check %>` can offer the
following repair options:

* `Reboot VM`: Instructs BOSH to reboot a VM. Rebooting can resolve many
  transient errors.
* `Ignore problem`: Instructs BOSH to do nothing.
  You may want to ignore a problem in order to run `bosh ssh` and attempt
  troubleshooting directly on the machine.
* `Reassociate VM with corresponding instance`: Updates the BOSH Director state
  database.
  Use this option if you believe that the BOSH Director state database is in
  error and that a VM is correctly associated with a job.
* `Recreate VM using last known apply spec`: Instructs BOSH to destroy the
  server and recreate it from the deployment manifest that the installer
  provides. Use this option if a VM is corrupted.
* `Delete VM reference`: Instructs BOSH to delete a VM reference in the
  Director state database. If a VM reference exists in the state database, BOSH
  expects to find an agent running on the VM.
  Select this option only if you know that this reference is in error.
  Once you delete the VM reference, BOSH can no longer control the VM.

To use this command, run `bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT <%= vars.bosh_cloud_check %>`. Replace `MY-ENV` with your environment, and `MY-DEPLOYMENT` with your deployment.

####Example Scenarios ####

**Unresponsive Agent**

<pre class='terminal'>
  $ bosh -e example-env -d example-deployment <%= vars.bosh_cloud_check %>
  ccdb/0 (vm-3e37133c-bc33-450e-98b1-f86d5b63502a) is not responding:

  - Ignore problem
  - Reboot VM
  - Recreate VM using last known apply spec
  - Delete VM reference (DANGEROUS!)
</pre>

**Missing VM**

<pre class='terminal'>
  $ bosh -e example-env -d example-deployment <%= vars.bosh_cloud_check %>
  VM with cloud ID `vm-3e37133c-bc33-450e-98b1-f86d5b63502a' missing:

  - Ignore problem
  - Recreate VM using last known apply spec
  - Delete VM reference (DANGEROUS!)
</pre>

**Unbound Instance VM**

<pre class='terminal'>
  $ bosh -e example-env -d example-deployment <%= vars.bosh_cloud_check %>
  VM `vm-3e37133c-bc33-450e-98b1-f86d5b63502a' reports itself as `ccdb/0' but does not have a bound instance:

  - Ignore problem
  - Delete VM (unless it has persistent disk)
  - Reassociate VM with corresponding instance
</pre>

**Out of Sync VM**

<pre class='terminal'>
  $ bosh -e example-env -d example-deployment <%= vars.bosh_cloud_check %>
  VM `vm-3e37133c-bc33-450e-98b1-f86d5b63502a' is out of sync:
  expected `cf-d7293430724a2c421061: ccdb/0', got `cf-d7293430724a2c421061: nats/0':

  - Ignore problem
  - Delete VM (unless it has persistent disk)
</pre>

### <a id='bosh-ssh'></a>BOSH SSH

Use `bosh ssh` to SSH into the VMs in your deployment.

Follow the steps below to use `bosh ssh`:

1. Identify a VM to SSH into. Run `bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT vms` to list the VMs in the given deployment. Replace `MY-ENV` with your environment alias and `MY-DEPLOYMENT` with the deployment name.

1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT ssh VM-NAME/GUID`. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e example-env -d example-deployment ssh diego-cell/abcd0123-a012-b345-c678-9def01234567</pre>
