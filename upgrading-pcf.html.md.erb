## <a id="monitor"></a> (Optional) Task 3: Monitor Upgrade

The following sections describe how to monitor your <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation during the upgrade and troubleshoot issues:

* [Check Status and Performance](#status)
* [Check Diego State](#diego)
* [Take Snapshots of Storage Metrics](#storage)
* [Collect Logs](#collect-logs)

###  <a id="status"></a> Check Status and Performance

You can monitor the progress of the upgrade by checking the status of the foundation at various locations.

VMware recommends live-monitoring your upgrade with Healthwatch, which captures, calculates, stores, visualizes, and alerts on platform metrics, including:

* BOSH-reported VM metrics
* Runtime component metrics
* [Key Performance Indicators](../monitoring/kpi.html) and [Key Scaling Indicators](../monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html)
* Healthwatch-generated [super metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/metrics.html)

For more information, see the [Healthwatch](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/index.html) documentation.

If you are not using Healthwatch, you can do some or all of the following to monitor upgrade progress:

* Use the BOSH CLI to check the status of a task, VM, or instance. For more information, see [Check Status Using BOSH CLI](#bosh-cli-status).

* Check app availability.

* Run cf CLI commands.

* Check the availability of the Ops Manager UI.

* If using a network-attached storage (NAS) server, check the server's performance.

* If on vSphere, check vSphere performance.

#### <a id='bosh-cli-status'></a> Check Status Using BOSH CLI

To check the status of a task:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS task TASK-NUMBER
    ```
    Where:
    * `ALIAS` is your BOSH alias.
    * `TASK-NUMBER` is the number of the upgrade task you want to check.

To check the status of a VM:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals
    ```
    Where `ALIAS` is your BOSH alias.

To check the status of an instance:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS instances --ps
    ```
    Where `ALIAS` is your BOSH alias.

### <a id="diego"></a> Check Diego State

You can use the CF Diego Operator Toolkit (cfdot) to check Diego component instance count by current state. For more information, see the [cfdot](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cfdot) repository on GitHub.

### <a id="storage"></a> Take Snapshots of Storage Metrics

You can periodically take snapshots of storage metrics. VMware recommends this if you have a large foundation and have experienced storage issues in the past.

###  <a id="collect-logs"></a> Collect Logs

If you encounter problems during upgrade:

1. Collect the following information:
    * All job logs
    * Task debug logs for VM upgrade tasks
    * The installation log from Ops Manager

This information helps determine the cause of upgrade issues.


## <a id="after"></a> Task 4: After Upgrade

The following sections describe how to prepare for use of your new environment, check its health status,
and clean up after upgrading:

* [Re-Create BOSH Alias](#bosh-alias)
* [Install New cf CLI](#cf-cli)
* [Check the Health of Your Deployment](#health)
* [Check Resource Settings](#resource-settings)
* [Run BOSH Clean-Up](#bosh-cleanup)

### <a id="bosh-alias"></a> Re-Create BOSH Alias

To log in to BOSH after upgrading <%= vars.platform_name %>, you must re-create your alias.

To re-create your alias using BOSH:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh alias-env ALIAS -e DIRECTOR-IP
    ```
    Where:
    * `ALIAS` is the BOSH alias you are re-creating.
    * `DIRECTOR-IP` is the IP address of your BOSH Director VM.

### <a id="cf-cli"></a> Install New cf CLI

To install the version of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) packaged with the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile on <%= vars.product_network %>:

1. Go to the [<%= vars.app_runtime_full %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime/) download page on <%= vars.product_network %>.

1. Click the **CF CLI** download button.

1. Unzip the cf CLI ZIP file containing compressed binaries for the cf CLI.

1. Follow the procedure in the [Install the cf CLI Using a Compressed Binary](../../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html#bin) section of the _Installing the cf CLI_ topic.

### <a id="health"></a> Check the Health of Your Deployment

Check the health of your deployment to ensure that all jobs and processes are running as expected.

To check the health of your deployment:

1. Check the health of each BOSH deployment in your installation by running:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME instances --ps
    bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals
    bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME cck --report
    ```
    Where:
    * `ALIAS` is your BOSH alias.
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name of your BOSH deployment.

1. Push and horizontally scale a test app to test <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> performance.

1. If you are running <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> MySQL as a cluster, run the `mysql-diag` tool to validate health of the cluster. For more information, see the BOSH CLI v2 instructions in [Running mysql-diag](../mysql/mysql-diag.html).

### <a id="resource-settings"></a> Check Resource Settings

If you added custom **VM Type** or **Persistent Disk Type** options, you must ensure that these values are correctly set and were not overwritten.

To check your custom resource settings:

1. Go to the Installation Dashboard and click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. Ensure that the values for **VM Type** and **Persistent Disk Type** are correct.

### <a id="bosh-cleanup"></a> Run BOSH Clean-Up

To clean up old stemcells, releases, orphaned disks, and other unused resources:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS clean-up --all
    ```
    Where `ALIAS` is the BOSH alias you are re-creating.


### <a id="restage-apps"></a> Restage Apps

VMware recommends telling developers to restage any apps that use buildpacks that were updated as a part of this upgrade.

For more information about how developers can restage apps, see [Restage Your App](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/devguide/deploy-apps/start-restart-restage.html#restage).
