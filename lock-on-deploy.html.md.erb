title: Ops Manager Fields That Lock On Deploy
owner: OpsManager
---

This topic describes how locked fields work in Pivotal Operations Manager, and lists the unlockable and permanently-locked fields in installation tiles.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Some fields in Ops Manager lock during deployment. After deployment, a locked field is no longer configurable via the Ops Manager UI or API endpoints. Product tile authors configure fields as locked to prevent irrevocable VM malfunction, deployment corruption, and data loss. Most users will not need to edit locked fields after initial deployment.

Because deployment requirements may evolve in unanticipated ways over time, some locked fields are _unlockable_, which means that an advanced <%= vars.product_name %> operator can unlock them to allow reconfiguration. Other fields are _permanently locked_, and their values cannot be changed. Unlocking the unlockable fields requires you to use Ops Manager's Advanced Mode. For more information about Advanced Mode, see [Unlockable Fields](#unlock).

In summary, there are three types of configurable fields in Ops Manager:

* **Standard fields**, which can be reconfigured after deployment as many times as you need.
* **Unlockable fields**, which lock on deployment but can be unlocked and configured with [Advanced Mode](#unlock).
* **Permanently-locked fields**, which lock on deployment and cannot be unlocked.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Pivotal recommends that only skilled operators use Ops Manager's Advanced Mode. If you use Advanced Mode incorrectly, you could disable or destroy your deployment.</p>

## <a id='unlock'></a>Unlockable Fields

This section describes the fields that lock during deployment and can be unlocked and configured after deployment. To unlock these fields, you must use Ops Manager's [Advanced Mode](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Enable-Advanced-Mode-in-the-Ops-Manager). 

After you have enabled Advanced Mode, you can use the API or Ops Manager UI to reconfigure some fields that were locked previously. Those fields are listed in the following section.

* **Bucket Name** in the **S3 Compatible Blobstore** section

In the **Assign AZs and Networks** pane, all fields lock permanently after deployment.

### <a id="product-tiles-locked"></a>Configurable Fields in Product Tiles

No fields other than the ones listed above lock in third-party product tiles. However, tile authors can specify which additional fields should lock on deploy by passing the `freeze-on-deploy` flag. 

For more information about this flag, see [Common Property Blueprint Attributes](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-2/property-template-references.html#common-attributes).
