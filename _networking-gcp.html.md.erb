1. Select **Networking**.

1. Leave the **Router IPs**, **SSH Proxy IPs** and **HAProxy IPs** fields blank. You do not need to complete these fields when deploying PCF to GCP. 
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You configure your load balancer in Elastic Runtime later, in the <a href="#config-lb">Configure Load Balancers</a> section below.</p>

1. Under **Select one of the following point-of-entry options**, choose the following option:
  * **Forward SSL to Elastic Runtime Router**: Select this option if your deployment uses an external load balancer that can forward encrypted traffic to the Elastic Runtime Router, or for a development environment that does not require load balancing. Complete the fields for the **Router SSL Termination Certificate and Private Key** and **Router SSL Ciphers**.
  <p class="note">For details about providing SSL termination certificates and keys, see the [Providing a Certificate for your SSL Termination Point](../opsguide/security_config.html#config) topic.</p> 

1. If you are not using SSL encryption or if you are using self-signed certificates, select **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment**. Selecting this checkbox also disables SSL verification for route services.

    <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: For production deployments, Pivotal does not recommend disabling SSL certificate verifcation.</p>

1. To set the secure flag for cookies generated by the router, select the **Disable insecure cookies on the Router** checkbox.

1. In the **Choose whether or not to enable route services** section, choose either **Enable route services** or **Disable route services**. 
Route services are a class of [marketplace services](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#marketplace) that perform filtering or content transformation on application requests and responses. 
See the [Route Services](../services/route-services.html) topic for details.

1. The **Loggregator Port** defaults to `443` if left blank. Enter a new value to override the default.

1. (Optional) Use the **Applications Subnet** field if you need to avoid address collision with a third-party service on the same subnet as your apps. Enter a CIDR subnet mask specifying the range of available IP addresses assigned to your app containers. The IP range must be different from the network used by the system VMs.

1. (Optional) You can change the value in the **Applications Network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)** field. Pivotal recommends setting the MTU value for your application network to `1454`. Some configurations, such as networks that use GRE tunnels, may require a smaller MTU value.   

1. (Optional) To accommodate larger uploads over connections with high latency, increase the number of seconds in the **Router Timeout to Backends** field. 

1. (Optional) Increase the value of **Load Balancer Unhealthy Threshold** to specify the amount of time, in seconds, that the router continues to accept connections before shutting down. During this period, healthchecks may report the router as unhealthy, which causes load balancers to failover to other routers. Set this value to an amount greater than or equal to the maximum time it takes your load balancer to consider a router instance unhealthy, given contiguous failed healthchecks.

1. (Optional) Modify the value of **Load Balancer Health Threshold**. This field specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait until declaring the Router instance started. This allows an external load balancer time to register the Router instance as healthy.
