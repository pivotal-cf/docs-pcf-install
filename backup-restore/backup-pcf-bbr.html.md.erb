<% current_page.data.title = "Backing Up " + vars.platform_name + " with BBR"  %>

<% $this_topic = 'backup-pcf' %>

This topic describes the procedure for backing up your critical back end <%= vars.platform_name  %> components with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR), a command-line tool for backing up and restoring BOSH deployments. To restore your backup, see the [Restoring <%= vars.platform_name %> from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

For BBR release notes, see [BOSH Backup and Restore Release Notes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/bbr-rn.html) in the Cloud Foundry documentation.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

During the backup, BBR stops the Cloud Controller API and the Cloud Controller workers to create a consistent backup. Only the API functionality is affected, such as when pushing apps or using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). The deployed apps do not experience downtime.

<div class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Backup artifacts can contain secrets. Secure backup artifacts by using encryption or other means.</li>
    <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> A BBR backup can only be restored to environments matching its source environment. To ensure that a restore environment is compatible with a backup, see <a href="#restore-compatibility">Compatibility of Restore</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Failed Restore:</strong> Restore is a destructive operation. BBR is designed to restore <%= vars.platform_name %> after a disaster. If a restore fails, the environment might be left in an unusable state and require re-provisioning. For more information, see <a href="restore-pcf-bbr.html">Restoring <%= vars.platform_name %> from Backup with BBR</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Data:</strong> BBR does not back up any service data.</li>
    <li><strong>API Outage:</strong> The Cloud Controller API does not send or receive calls during <%= vars.platform_name %> restoration.</li>
  </ul>
</div>


## <a id='recs'></a> Recommendations

Pivotal recommends:

* Follow the full procedure documented in this topic when creating a backup. This ensures that you always have a consistent backup of Pivotal Operations Manager and PAS to restore from.

* Back up frequently, especially before making any changes to your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment, such as the configuration of any tiles in Ops Manager.

* You can prune the BOSH blobstore by running `bosh clean-up --all` before you run a backup of the BOSH Director. The command removes all unused resources including packages compiled against older stemcell versions. If a lot of unused resources have accumulated over time, you create a smaller, faster backup of the BOSH Director. For more information see [Clean-Up](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2/#clean-up) in the BOSH documentation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>The command <code>bosh clean-up --all</code> is a destructive operation
and can remove resources that are unused but needed.
For example, if an On-Demand Service Broker is deployed <strong>and</strong> no service instances have been created,
the releases needed to create a service instance will be categorised as unused.
</p>


## <a id='supported'></a> Supported Components

BBR is a binary that can back up and restore BOSH deployments and BOSH Directors. BBR requires that the backup targets supply scripts that implement the backup and restore functions. BBR can communicate securely with external blobstores and databases, using TLS, if these are configured accordingly.

BBR can back up Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and BOSH Director.

### <a id='pas-support'></a> PAS

BBR can back up and restore PAS configured with:

* An internal MySQL database or a supported external database. For a list of supported external databases, see the [Supported External Databases](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/cf-backup.html#supported-external-databases) section of _Configuring Cloud Foundry for BOSH Backup and Restore_ in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

* An internal WebDAV/NFS blobstore, an external Amazon S3 or S3-compatible blobstore, or an external Azure blobstore.

For guidance about backing up unsupported databases and blobstores,
see [Unsupported External Blobstores and Databases in PAS](#guidelines) below.

### <a id='bosh-director-support'></a> BOSH Director

BBR can back up and restore the BOSH Director configured with:

* An internal PostgreSQL database or a supported external database. As part of backing up the BOSH Director, BBR backs up the BOSH UAA database and the CredHub database. For a list of supported external databases, see the [Supported External Databases](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/cf-backup.html#supported-external-databases) section of _Configuring Cloud Foundry for BOSH Backup and Restore_ in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

* An internal blobstore or an external versioned S3 blobstore.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> BBR support for backing up and restoring external databases and blobstores varies across <%= vars.platform_name %> versions. For more information, see <a href="#version-compatibility">External Storage Support Across <%= vars.platform_name %> Versions</a>.</p>


## <a id="version-compatibility"></a> External Storage Support Across <%= vars.platform_name %> Versions

The following table shows what types of external databases and blobstores you can back up and restore with BBR.

## <a id="guidelines"></a> Unsupported External Blobstores and Databases in PAS

If you configured an unsupported external blobstore or an unsupported external database in PAS, see the following guidelines to perform a backup successfully:

| Scenario | Action |
| -------- | ------ |
| You configured a supported database and an unsupported external blobstore in PAS. | Follow the <%= vars.platform_name %> backup process and copy the external blobstore by using the IaaS-specific tool. |
| You configured an unsupported external database and a supported blobstore in PAS. | Follow the <%= vars.platform_name %> backup process and copy the external database by using the IaaS-specific tool. |
| You configured both an unsupported external database and an unsupported external blobstore in PAS. | Follow the <%= vars.platform_name %> backup process but skip [Back Up Your PAS Deployment](#bbr-backup). Copy the external database and blobstore by using the IaaS-specific tool. |

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> You might encounter inconsistencies between the blobstore and database. If apps do not appear during a restore, re-push those apps.</p>


## <a id='backup-services'></a> Backing Up Services

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> BBR does not currently back up any service data.</p>

When backing up services:

* BBR backs up and restores the service bindings, but not the service data.

* You can redeploy on-demand service instances manually during restore, but the data in the instance is not backed up.

* BBR does not back up managed services or their data.

* You can back up and restore brokered services with the procedures documented in this topic and in [Restoring <%= vars.platform_name %> from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html).


## <a id='workflow'></a> Backup Workflow

BBR examines the jobs in the BOSH deployment, and triggers the scripts in the following stages:

1. **Pre-backup lock**: The pre-backup lock scripts locks the job so backups are consistent across the cluster.

1. **Backup**: The backup script backs up the release.

1. **Post-backup unlock**: The post-backup unlock script unlocks the job after the backup is complete.

Scripts in the same stage are all triggered together. For instance, BBR triggers all pre-backup lock scripts before any backup scripts. Scripts within a stage can be triggered in any order.

The backup artifacts are drained to the jumpbox, where the operator can transfer them to storage and use them to restore <%= vars.platform_name %>.

The following diagram shows a sample backup flow.

<%= image_tag('backup-flow.png') %>


## <a id='prepare'></a> Preparing to Create Your Backup

### <a id='setup-jumpbox'></a> Step 1: Set Up Your Jumpbox

You must have a jumpbox before you can install BBR to the jumpbox. A jumpbox is a separate, hardened server on your network that provides a controlled means of access to the VMs other computers on your network.

Pivotal recommends using the Ops Manager VM as your jumpbox. If you use the Ops Manager VM as your jumpbox, the path to the root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate is:

```
/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
```

You must have this path to run BBR commands.

As an alternative to using the Ops Manager VM as your jumpbox, you can:

* Use Concourse to back up a <%= vars.platform_name %> installation using BBR. For more information, see the [BBR <%= vars.platform_name %> Pipeline Tasks](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bbr-pcf-pipeline-tasks) GitHub repository.

* Configure a custom jumpbox. For more information, see [Configuring a custom jumpbox for BBR](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Configuring-a-Custom-Jumpbox-for-BBR) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.

### <a id='encrypt-key'></a> Step 2: Record the Cloud Controller Database Encryption Credentials

To retrieve the Cloud Controller database encryption credentials from the PAS tile:

1. Navigate to Ops Manager in a browser and log in to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the PAS tile.

1. Select **Credentials** and locate the Cloud Controller section.

1. Record the **Db Encryption Credentials**. You must provide these credentials when you contact [Pivotal Support](https://support.pivotal.io) for help restoring your installation.

	<%= image_tag("ccdb-encrypt-creds.png") %>

### <a id="retrieve-credentials"></a> Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials

<%# Find this partial in GitHub at `pivotal-cf/docs-partials` %>
<%= partial "/pcf/core/#{vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-')}/backup-restore/bosh_retrieve_credentials" %>

### <a id="retrieve-address"></a> Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address

Perform the following steps to retrieve the IP address of your BOSH Director from the BOSH Director tile:

<%# Find this partial in GitHub at `pivotal-cf/docs-partials` %>
<%= partial "/pcf/core/#{vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-')}/backup-restore/bosh_target_director_bbr" %>

### <a id='check-director'></a> Step 5: Check Your BOSH Director

This section describes the procedures you must perform to confirm that your BOSH Director is reachable and can be backed up.

#### <a id='connect-jumpbox'></a> Connect to Your Jumpbox

You can establish a connection to your jumpbox in one of the following ways.

* [Option 1: Connect with SSH](#ssh)
* [Option 2: Connect with BOSH&#95;ALL&#95;PROXY](#bosh-all-proxy)

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> These procedures require you have a jumpbox configured for SSH access. If you do not have a jumpbox, see <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/jumpbox/">Enabling SSH Access</a> and <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-tunnel/">Tunneling</a> in the BOSH documentation.</p>

<a id='ssh'></a> **Option 1: Connect with SSH**

To connect to your jumpbox with SSH, do one of the following:

* If you are using the Ops Manager VM as your jumpbox, log in to the Ops Manager VM. For more information, see [Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](../trouble-advanced.html#ssh) in the _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ topic.

* To connect to your jumpbox using the command line, run:

    ```
    ssh -i PATH-TO-KEY JUMPBOX-USERNAME@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS
    ```
    Where:
    * `PATH-TO-KEY` is the local path to your private key file for the jumpbox host.
    * `JUMPBOX-USERNAME` is your jumpbox username.
    * `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the IP address or hostname of the jumpbox.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you connect to your jumpbox with SSH, you must run the BBR commands in this topic from within your jumpbox.</p>

<a id='bosh-all-proxy'></a> **Option 2: Connect with BOSH&#95;ALL&#95;PROXY**

You can use the environment variable `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` to open an SSH tunnel with SOCKS5 to the jumpbox. This tunnel enables you to forward requests from your local machine to the BOSH Director through the jumpbox. When `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` is set, the BBR CLI uses its value to forward requests to the BOSH Director.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For the following procedures to work, ensure the SOCKS port is not already in
  use by a different tunnel or process.</p>

To connect with `BOSH_ALL_PROXY`, do one of the following:

* To establish the tunnel separate from the BOSH CLI:
  1. Establish the tunnel and make it available on a local port by running:

      ```
      ssh -4 -D SOCKS-PORT -fNC JUMPBOX-USERNAME@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS -i JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE -o ServerAliveInterval=60
      ```
      Where:
      * `SOCKS-PORT` is the local SOCKS port.
      * `JUMPBOX-USERNAME` is your jumpbox username.
      * `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the IP address or hostname of the jumpbox.
      * `JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE` is the local SSH private key for accessing the jumpbox.
  1. Provide the BOSH CLI with access to the tunnel using the `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` environment variable by running:

      ```
      export BOSH_ALL_PROXY=socks5://localhost:SOCKS-PORT
      ```
      Where is `SOCKS-PORT` is your local SOCKS port.

* To establish the tunnel using the BOSH CLI, provide the BOSH CLI with the necessary SSH credentials to create the tunnel by running:

      ```
      export BOSH_ALL_PROXY=ssh+socks5://JUMPBOX-USERNAME@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS:SOCKS-PORT?private_key=JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE
      ```
      Where:
      * `JUMPBOX-USERNAME` is your jumpbox username.
      * `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the IP address or hostname of the jumpbox.
      * `SOCKS-PORT` is the local SOCKS port.
      * `JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE` is the local SSH private key for accessing the jumpbox.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Using <code>BOSH_ALL_PROXY</code> can result in longer backup and restore times due to network performance degradation. All operations must pass through the proxy, therefore, moving backup artifacts can be significantly slower.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> In BBR v1.5.0 and earlier, the tunnel created by the BOSH CLI does not include the <code>ServerAliveInterval</code> flag. This might cause your SSH connection to time out when transferring large artifacts. In BBR v1.5.1, the <code>ServerAliveInterval</code> flag is included. For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore/releases/tag/v1.5.1">bosh-backup-and-restore</a> on GitHub.</p>

#### <a id='check-bosh-director'></a> Check Your BOSH Director

To check your BOSH Director:

1. Run:

    ```
  	bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    --username bbr \
    --host HOST \
    pre-backup-check
  	```
  	Where:
  	* `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
  	* `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, HOST` is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, `HOST` is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` which you retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Use the optional <code>--debug</code> flag to enable debug logs. For more information, see <a href="#logging">Logging</a>.</p>

1. After the pre-backup check succeeds, continue to [Step 5: Confirm Backup Restore Node is Deployed](#backup-restore-node). If the pre-backup check fails, the BOSH Director might not have the correct backup scripts, or the connection to the BOSH Director might have failed.

### <a id='backup-restore-node'></a> Step 6: Confirm Backup Restore Node is Deployed

When BBR backs up PAS, it needs a Backup Restore node.

To confirm that the Backup Restore node is deployed:

1. In the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> tile.

1. In the **Resource Config** pane, find the **Backup Restore Node** job and check if the **Instances** dropdown is set to `1`.
<%= image_tag("backup-restore-node.png") %>

1. If the **Instances** dropdown is not set to `1`:
  1. Set the **Instances** dropdown to **1**.
  1. Click **Save**.
  1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
  1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
  1. Review your changes. For more information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](../review-pending-changes.html).
  1. Click **Apply Changes**.

### <a id='identify-deployment'></a> Step 7: Identify Your Deployment

To identify the name of the BOSH deployment that contains <%= vars.platform_name %>:

1. Log in to your BOSH Director.

1. To identify the name of the BOSH deployment that contains <%= vars.platform_name %>, run:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE deployments
    ```
    Where:
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE deployments

    Name                     Release(s)
    cf-example               push-apps-manager-release/661.1.24
                             cf-backup-and-restore/0.0.1
                             binary-buildpack/1.0.11
                             capi/1.28.0
                             cf-autoscaling/91
                             cf-mysql/35
                             ...
    </pre>

    In the above example, the name of the BOSH deployment that contains <%= vars.platform_name %> is `cf-example`.

### <a id='check'></a> Step 8: Check Your Deployment

To check that your BOSH Director is reachable and has a deployment that can be backed up:

1. Run:

    ```
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    pre-backup-check
  	```
    Where:
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**, identity and password, that you retrieved in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name retrieved in [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the root CA certificate for the BOSH Director. If you are using the Ops Manager VM as your jumpbox, the path is `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate`.

1. After the pre-backup check succeeds, continue to [Create Your Backup](#procedure). If the pre-backup check fails, the deployment you selected might not have the correct backup scripts, or the connection to the BOSH Director might have failed.


## <a id='procedure'></a> Create Your Backup

### <a id='export'></a> Step 9: Export Installation Settings

Pivotal recommends that you back up your Ops Manager installation settings by exporting frequently.

When exporting your installation settings, keep in mind:

* This option is only available after you have deployed at least once.

* Always export your installation settings before following the steps in the [Deploy Ops Manager and Import Installation Settings](./restore-pcf-bbr.html#deploy-import) section of the _Restoring <%= vars.platform_name %> from Backup with BBR_ topic.

* Exporting your installation settings only backs up the settings you configured in Ops Manager. It does not back up your VMs or any external MySQL databases.

* Your Ops Manager settings are encrypted. Ensure you keep track of your Decryption Passphrase, because you need it to restore the Ops Manager settings.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When exporting installation settings for Ops Manager v1.12 and later, releases are not included in the output file. Releases are now included in the BOSH Director backup, therefore, the output file is much smaller than in previous Ops Manager versions.</p>

There are two ways to export Ops Manager installation settings:

- [Use the Ops Manager UI](#export-using-ui)
- [Use the Ops Manager API](#export-using-api)

#### <a id='export-using-ui'></a> Option 1: Use the Ops Manager UI

To export your installation settings using the Ops Manager UI:

1. From the Installation Dashboard, click your username at the top right navigation.

1. Select **Settings**.

1. Select **Export Installation Settings**.

1. Click **Export Installation Settings**.
    <%= image_tag("settings.png") %>

#### <a id='export-using-api'></a> Option 2: Use the Ops Manager API

If you want to automate the backup process, you can use the Ops Manager API to export your installation settings.

To export your installation settings using the Ops Manager API:

1. Run:

    ```
    curl https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/installation_asset_collection \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" > installation.zip
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token. For more information, see the [Access the API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html#access-api) section of the _Using the Ops Manager API_ topic.

### <a id='bbr-backup-director'></a> Step 10: Back Up BOSH Director

<div class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The BOSH Director backup can take more than 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Because the BBR <code>backup</code> command can take a long time to complete, Pivotal recommends you run it independently of the SSH session so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails.<br>Use <code>nohup</code>, a <code>screen</code>, or a <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

To back up BOSH Director:

1. Run:

    ```
    bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    --username bbr \
    --host HOST \
    backup
    ```
    Where:
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director:
      * If the BOSH Director is public, `HOST` is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`.
      * If the BOSH Director is not public, `HOST` is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).

    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Use the optional <code>--debug</code> flag to enable debug logs. For more information, see <a href="#logging">Logging</a>.</p>

If your backup terminates early or fails, you must perform a cleanup.

To clean up:

1. Run:

    ```
    bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    --username bbr \
    --host HOST \
    backup-cleanup
    ```
    Where:
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director:
      * If the BOSH Director is public, `HOST` is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`.
      * If the BOSH Director is not public, `HOST` is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).

### <a id='bbr-backup'></a> Step 11: Back Up Your PAS Deployment

<div class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Backing up PAS can take more than 5 minutes, and can take considerably longer with larger blobstores or slow network connections. The backup also incurs Cloud Controller downtime during which users are unable to push, scale, or delete apps. Your apps are not affected.</li>
    <li>Because the BBR <code>backup</code> command can take a long time to complete, Pivotal recommends you run it independently of the SSH session, so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code> but you could also run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

To back up your PAS deployment:

1. (Optional) If you are not using an internal blobstore or a versioned S3-compatible external blobstore, create a copy of the blobstore with your IaaS-specific tool. Your blobstore backup might be slightly inconsistent with your PAS backup depending on the duration of time between performing the backups.

1. Run:

    ```
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    backup
    ```
    Where:
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**, identity and password, that you retrieved in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name retrieved in [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director.
    * Use the optional `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information, see [Logging](#logging).
    * Use the optional `--with-manifest` flag to ensure that BBR downloads your current deployment manifest when backing up. These manifests are included in the Ops Manager export, but are useful for reference.

1. After the command successfully completes, continue to [Step 11: Transfer Backup Artifacts](#transfer-artifacts). If the command fails:

  1. Run:

        ```
        bbr deployment \
        --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
        --username BOSH-CLIENT \
        --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
        --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
        --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
        backup-cleanup
        ```
        Where:
        * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
        * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**, identity and password, that you retrieved in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
        * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name retrieved in [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
        * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director.
        * Use the optional `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information, see [Logging](#logging).
        * Use the optional `--with-manifest` flag to ensure that BBR downloads your current deployment manifest when backing up. These manifests are included in the Ops Manager export, but are useful for reference.

  1. Run the BBR `backup` command again after ensuring that:
      * All the parameters in the command are set.
      * The BOSH Director credentials are valid.
      * The specified deployment exists.


## <a id='after'></a> After Taking Your Backup

This section describes the procedures you must perform after taking your backup.

### <a id='transfer-artifacts'></a> Step 12: Transfer Backup Artifacts

After creating your backup successfully:

1. Move the backup artifacts off the jumpbox to your preferred storage space. The backup created by BBR consists of a directory with the backup artifacts and metadata files. Pivotal recommends compressing and encrypting the files.

1. Make redundant copies of your backup artifacts and store them in multiple locations to minimize the risk of losing backups in the event of a disaster.

1. Attempt to restore every backup to validate the artifacts. For more information, see [Step 13: Validate Your Backup](#validate-backup).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Backup artifacts might contain data covered by European Union regulations. For more information, see <a href="#gdpr">European Union's <em>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em></a>.</p>

### <a id='validate-backup'></a> Step 13: (Optional) Validate Your Backup

After backing up <%= vars.platform_name %>, consider validating your backup by restoring it and checking the apps. BBR is designed for disaster recovery and BBR backups are only compatible with environments matching their source environment's configuration.

<div class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The VMs and disks from the backed-up BOSH Director must not be visible to the new BOSH Director</strong> when validating your backup. As a result, Pivotal recommends that you deploy the new BOSH Director to a different IaaS network and account than the VMs and disks of the backed-up BOSH Director.</li>
    <li><strong>Data services outside of <%= vars.platform_name %> might produce unexpected side effects during restoration.</strong> Restored apps and services might attempt to connect to data services when you restore to a new environment. For example, consider an app that processes mail queues and connects to an external database. When you validate your backup in a test environment, the app might start processing the queue, and this work might be lost.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### <a id='full-validate'></a> Validate Your Backup in a Second Environment

To spin up a second environment and test the backup:

1. Export your Ops Manager installation by performing the procedure in [Step 8: Export Installation Settings](#export).

1. Create a new Ops Manager VM in a different network to the original. Ensure that the Ops Manager VM has enough persistent disk to accommodate the files exported in the previous step. For more informations, see the [IaaS-Specific Deployment Guidelines](../deploy-bosh-om.html#contents) section of the _Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager_ topic.

1. Ensure that the restore environment is compatible with the backup. For more information, see the [Compatibility of Restore](./restore-pcf-bbr.html#compatibility) section of the _Restoring <%= vars.platform_name %> from Backup with BBR_ topic.

1. Follow the procedures in [Restoring <%= vars.platform_name %> from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html).

#### <a id='ert-validate'></a> Validate Your PAS Backup Only

For a sandbox or other non-production environment, you can optionally perform an _in-place_ restore of PAS only. In this case, you restore the PAS backup to the same <%= vars.platform_name %> environment that the backup was created from. For more information, see the [Step 12: Redeploy PAS](restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-ert) section of the _Restoring <%= vars.platform_name %> from Backup with BBR_ topic.


## <a id='logging'></a> Logging

BBR outputs logs to stdout. By default, BBR logs:

* The backup and restore scripts that it finds
* When it starts or finishes a stage, such as pre-backup scripts or backup scripts
* When the process is complete
* When any error occurs

If you require additional logging, use the optional `--debug` flag to print:

* Logs about the API requests made to the BOSH server
* All commands executed on remote instances
* All commands executed on local environment
* Standard in and standard out streams for the backup and restore scripts when they are executed


## <a id='canceling-backup'></a> Canceling a Backup

To cancel a backup:

1. Enter `CTRL-C` to terminate the BBR process, then enter `yes` to confirm.

1. Run the BBR `backup-cleanup` command.
    * For a canceled director backup, run:

        ```
        bbr director \
        --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
        --username bbr \
        --host HOST \
        backup-cleanup
        ```
        Where:
        * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
        * `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director:
          * If the BOSH Director is public, `HOST` is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`.
          * If the BOSH Director is not public, `HOST` is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * For a canceled deployment backup, run:

        ```
        bbr deployment \
        --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
        --username BOSH-CLIENT \
        --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
        --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
        --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
        backup-cleanup
        ```
        Where:
        * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
        * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**, identity and password, that you retrieved in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
        * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name retrieved in [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
        * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director.
        * Use the optional `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information, see [Logging](#logging).
        * Use the optional `--with-manifest` flag to ensure that BBR downloads your current deployment manifest when backing up. These manifests are included in the Ops Manager export, but are useful for reference.
