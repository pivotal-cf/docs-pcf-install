<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Changes:</strong> Read the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/pcf-release-notes/index.html">Release Notes</a> and <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html">Breaking Changes</a> for this release, including the Known Issues sections, before starting the upgrade process.</p>

The apps in your deployment continue to run during the upgrade. However, you cannot write to your deployment or make changes to apps during the upgrade.

For details about how upgrading PCF impacts individual PAS components, see [What Happens During PAS Upgrades](../upgrading/understanding-pas.html).


## <a id="prepare"></a> Prepare to Upgrade

If you have not already, complete the steps in the [Upgrade Preparation Checklist for PCF <%= vars.v_major_version %>](../upgrading/checklist.html).


## <a id="upgrade_ops"></a> Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to <%= vars.v_major_version %>

Follow these steps to upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to PCF <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

### <a id="upgrade"></a> Import Installation to Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %> VM

1. Download the Ops Manager VM Template <%= vars.v_major_version %> from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager) site.

1. Record the FQDN address of the existing Ops Manager VM.

1. To avoid conflicts, power off the existing Ops Manager VM.

1. Deploy the new Ops Manager VM by following the steps in one of these topics:
    * **AWS**: [Upgrading BOSH Director on AWS](./aws-om-upgrade.html)
    * **Azure**: [Upgrading BOSH Director on Azure](./azure-om-upgrade.html)
    * **GCP**: [Upgrading BOSH Director on GCP](./gcp-om-upgrade.html)
    * **OpenStack**: [Deploying Ops Manager to OpenStack](../om/openstack/setup.html)
    * **vSphere**: [Deploying Ops Manager on vSphere](../om/vsphere/deploy.html)

1. When redirected to the **Welcome to Ops Manager** page, select **Import Existing Installation**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/welcome.png") %>

1. When prompted, enter the **Decryption Passphrase** for this Ops Manager installation. You set this passphrase during your initial installation of Ops Manager.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If lost, the <strong>Decryption Passphrase</strong> cannot be recovered.</p>

1. Click **Choose File** and browse to the installation ZIP file exported in the [Export Your Installation](../upgrading/checklist.html#export) step of your upgrade preparation.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/decryption_passphrase.png") %>

1. Click **Import**.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the import process, and might appear to hang.</p>

1. A **Successfully imported installation** message appears upon completion.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/success.png") %>

### <a id="upgrade_products"></a> Import New PAS and Product Tiles

<a name="success"></a> After upgrading to Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %>, upgrade your product versions:

1. Import the product file to your Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Hover over the product name in **Available Products** and click **Add**.

1. Click the newly-added tile to review any configurable options.

1. (Optional) If you use other service tiles, you can upgrade them following the same procedure. See the [Upgrading PAS and Other Pivotal Cloud Foundry Products](./upgrading-products.html) topic for more information.

### <a id="perform-upgrade"></a> Perform Your Upgrade

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If the installation fails or returns errors, contact <%= vars.support_link %>. Do not attempt to roll back the upgrade by restarting the previous (v2.3) Ops Manager VM.</p>

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**. This immediately imports and applies upgrades to all tiles in a single transaction.

1. Click each service tile, select the **Status** tab, and confirm that all VMs appear and are in good health.

1. After confirming that the new installation functions correctly, remove the Ops Manager v2.3 VM.


## <a id="monitor"></a> Monitor Upgrade

During the upgrade, you can do the following to monitor your PCF foundation and help troubleshoot any issues.

###  <a id="status"></a> Check Status and Performance

**Note/Reason**: <br>
Monitor the progress of the upgrade, checking the status of the foundation at various locations.<br>
**Product/Component**:<br>
PCF

Pivotal recommends live-monitoring your upgrade with PCF Healthwatch, which monitors and alerts on the current health, performance, and capacity of PCF. Healthwatch captures, calculates, stores, visualizes, and alerts on PCF platform metrics, including:

- BOSH-reported VM metrics
- Runtime component metrics
- [Key Performance Indicators](../../monitoring/kpi.html) and [Key Scaling Indicators](../../monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html)
- Healthwatch-generated [super metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/metrics.html)

For more information, see the [PCF Healthwatch documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/index.html).

If you are not using PCF Healthwatch, you can do some or all of the following to monitor upgrade progress:

* Run BOSH CLI status checks:
  * `bosh -e ALIAS task TASK_NUMBER`
  * `bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals, bosh -e ALIAS instances --ps`
* Check app availability
* Run cf CLI Commands
* Check the availability of the Ops Manager UI
* Check NAS performance (if using NAS)
* Check vSphere performance (if on vSphere)

### <a id="diego"></a> Check Diego State

**Note/Reason**:<br>
See the [cfdot documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cfdot) on GitHub for details.<br>
**Product/Component**:<br>
PAS

Use the CF Diego Operator Toolkit (cfdot) to check Diego component instance count by current state.

### <a id="storage"></a> (Optional) Take Snapshots of Storage Metrics

**Reason**:<br>
Pivotal recommends this if you have a large foundation and have experienced storage issues in the past.<br>
**Product/Component**:<br>
PCF

Periodically take snapshots of storage metrics.

###  <a id="collect-logs"></a> (Optional) Collect Logs

**Reason**:<br>
This information helps determine the cause of upgrade issues.<br>
**Product/Component**:<br>
PCF

If you encounter problems during upgrade, collect the following information:

* All job logs
* Task debug logs for VM upgrade tasks
* Installation log from Ops Manager


## <a id="after"></a> After Upgrade

After your upgrade, do the following to prepare for use of your new environment, check its health status, and clean up.

### <a id="bosh-alias"></a> Re-Create BOSH Alias

Re-create your alias using BOSH: `bosh alias-env ALIAS -e DIRECTOR_IP`

* **Reason**: To log in to BOSH after upgrading PCF, you need to re-create your alias.
* **Product/Component**: BOSH

### <a id="cf-cli"></a> Install New cf CLI

Download the version of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) packaged with the [PAS](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime/) tile on Pivotal Network.

### <a id="health"></a> Check the Health of Your Deployment

1. Run BOSH CLI commands to check system status:
  1. `bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME instances --ps`
  1. `bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals`
  1. `bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME cck --report`

    **Note/Reason**: To ensure that all jobs and process are running as expected<br>
    **Product/Component**: PCF and all tiles

1. Push and horizontally scale a test application.
  * **Reason**: This is a performance test for PAS.
  * **Product/Component**: PCF

1. If you are running PAS MySQL as a cluster, run the `mysql-diag` tool to validate health of the cluster.
  * **Reason**: See the BOSH CLI v2 instructions in the [Running mysql-diag](../mysql/mysql-diag.html) topic.
  * **Product/Component**: PAS

### <a id="resource-settings"></a> Check Resource Settings

If you added custom **VM Type** or **Persistent Disk Type** options, ensure that these values are correctly set and were not overwritten.

* **Note/Reason**: Verify that the Ops Manager **Resource Config** pane still lists your custom options.
* **Product/Component**: PCF

### <a id="bosh-cleanup"></a> Run BOSH Clean-Up

Run `bosh -e ALIAS clean-up --all` to clean up old stemcells, releases, orphaned disks, and other unused resources.

* **Product/Component**: Tiles
