title: Backing Up Deployments with BBR
owner: RelEng
---

This topic describes the procedure for backing up your critical
back end components with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR),
a command-line tool for backing up and restoring BOSH deployments.
To restore your backup, see [Restoring Deployments from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html).

For BBR release notes, see [BOSH Backup and Restore Release Notes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/bbr-rn.html) in the Cloud Foundry documentation.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

During the backup, BBR stops the Cloud Foundry API (CAPI) and the Cloud Controller workers to create a consistent backup. Only the API functionality is affected, such as when pushing apps or using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). The deployed apps do not experience downtime.

<div class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> Backup artifacts can contain secrets. Secure backup artifacts by using encryption or other means.</li>
      <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> A BBR backup can only be restored to environments matching its source environment. To ensure that a restore environment is compatible with a backup, see <a href="./restore-pcf-bbr.html#compatibility">Compatibility of Restore</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Failed Restore:</strong> Restore is a destructive operation. BBR is designed to restore deployments after a disaster. If a restore fails, the environment might be left in an unusable state and require re-provisioning. For more information, see <a href="restore-pcf-bbr.html">Restoring Deployments from Backup with BBR</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Data:</strong> BBR does not back up any service data.</li>
      <li><strong>API Outage:</strong> CAPI does not send or receive calls during restore.</li>
    </ul>
</div>


## <a id='recs'></a> Recommendations

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends:

* Follow the full procedure documented in this topic when creating a backup.
  This ensures that you always have a consistent backup to restore from.

* Back up frequently, especially before making any changes to your deployment,
  such as the configuration of any tiles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

* You can prune the BOSH blobstore by running `bosh clean-up --all` before you run a backup of the BOSH Director. The command removes all unused resources including packages compiled against older stemcell versions. If a lot of unused resources have accumulated over time, you create a smaller, faster backup of the BOSH Director. For more information see [Clean-Up](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2/#clean-up) in the BOSH documentation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Running the <code>bosh clean-up --all</code> command is a destructive operation and can remove resources that are unused but needed. For example, if an On-Demand Service Broker is deployed <strong>and</strong> no service instances have been created, the releases needed to create a service instance are categorized as unused.</p>


## <a id='supported'></a> Supported Components

BBR is a binary that can back up and restore BOSH deployments and BOSH Directors. BBR requires that the backup targets supply scripts that implement the backup and restore functions. BBR can communicate securely with external blobstores and databases, using TLS, if these are configured accordingly.

BBR can back up <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) and BOSH Director.

### <a id='pas-support'></a> <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>

BBR can back up and restore <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> configured with:

* An internal MySQL database or a supported external database. For a list of supported external databases, see [Supported External Databases](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/cf-backup.html#supported-external-databases) in _Configuring Cloud Foundry for BOSH Backup and Restore_ in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

* An internal WebDAV/NFS blobstore, an external Amazon S3 or S3-compatible blobstore, or an external Azure blobstore.

For guidance about backing up unsupported databases and blobstores,
see [Unsupported External Blobstores and Databases in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](#guidelines).

### <a id='bosh-director-support'></a> BOSH Director

BBR can back up and restore the BOSH Director configured with:

* An internal PostgreSQL database or a supported external database. As part of backing up the BOSH Director, BBR backs up the BOSH UAA database and the CredHub database. For a list of supported external databases, see [Supported External Databases](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/cf-backup.html#supported-external-databases) in _Configuring Cloud Foundry for BOSH Backup and Restore_ in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

* An internal blobstore or an external versioned S3 blobstore.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> BBR support for backing up and restoring external databases and blobstores varies across <%= vars.platform_name %> versions. For more information, see <a href="#version-compatibility">External Storage Support Across <%= vars.platform_name %> Versions</a>.</p>


## <a id="version-compatibility"></a> External Storage Support Across <%= vars.platform_name %> Versions

## <a id="guidelines"></a> Unsupported External Blobstores and Databases in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>

If you configured an unsupported external blobstore or an unsupported external database in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, see the following guidelines to perform a backup successfully:

| Scenario | Action |
| -------- | ------ |
| You configured a supported database and an unsupported external blobstore in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. | Follow the backup procedures and copy the external blobstore by using the IaaS-specific tool. |
| You configured an unsupported external database and a supported blobstore in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. | Follow the backup procedures and copy the external database by using the IaaS-specific tool. |
| You configured both an unsupported external database and an unsupported external blobstore in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. | Follow the backup procedures but skip [Back Up Your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Deployment](#bbr-backup). Copy the external database and blobstore by using the IaaS-specific tool. |

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> You might encounter inconsistencies between the blobstore and database. If apps do not appear during a restore, re-push those apps.</p>


## <a id='backup-services'></a> Backing Up Services

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> BBR does not currently back up any service data.</p>

When backing up services:

* BBR backs up and restores the service bindings, but not the service data.

* You can redeploy on-demand service instances manually during restore, but the data in the instance is not backed up.

* BBR does not back up managed services or their data.

* You can back up and restore brokered services with the procedures documented in this topic and in [Restoring Deployments from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html).


## <a id='workflow'></a> Backup Workflow

BBR examines the jobs in the BOSH deployment, and triggers the scripts in the following stages:

1. **Pre-backup lock:** The pre-backup lock scripts locks the job so backups are consistent across the cluster.

1. **Backup:** The backup script backs up the release.

1. **Post-backup unlock:** The post-backup unlock script unlocks the job after the backup is complete.

Scripts in the same stage are all triggered together. For instance, BBR triggers all pre-backup lock scripts before any backup scripts. Scripts within a stage can be triggered in any order.

The backup artifacts are drained to the jumpbox,
where the operator can transfer them to storage and use them to restore the deployment.

The following diagram shows a sample backup flow:

<%= image_tag('backup-flow.png', alt: 'The operator runs bbr backup pcf-deployment, calling the
backup scripts. The scripts transfer artifacts from deployment to jumpbox. The artifacts transfer
from the network/AZ to a secondary backup store.') %>


## <a id='prepare'></a> Prepare to Create Your Backup

### <a id='setup-jumpbox'></a> Step 1: Set Up Your Jumpbox

You must have a jumpbox before you can install BBR to the jumpbox. A jumpbox is a separate, hardened server on your network that provides a controlled means of access to the VMs other computers on your network.

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM as your jumpbox. If you use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM as your jumpbox, the path to the root certificate authority (CA) is:

```
/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
```

You must use this path to run BBR commands.

As an alternative to using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM as your jumpbox, you can:

* Use Concourse to back up a deployment using BBR.
  For more information, see the [BBR PCF Pipeline Tasks](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bbr-pcf-pipeline-tasks) repository on GitHub.

* Configure a custom jumpbox.
  For more information, see [VMware Tanzu Support documentation](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Configuring-a-Custom-Jumpbox-for-BBR) in the Knowledge Base.

### <a id='encrypt-key'></a> Step 2: Record the Cloud Controller Database Encryption Credentials

To retrieve the Cloud Controller database encryption credentials from the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Select **Credentials**.

1. Locate the **Cloud Controller** section.

1. Record the **Db Encryption Credentials**.
  You must provide these credentials when you contact [Support](https://support.pivotal.io) for help restoring your installation.

  <%= image_tag("ccdb-encrypt-creds.png", alt: "Screenshot showing Link to Credential buttons for VM Credentials, Db Encryption Credentials, Encrypt Key, and Locket Client Cert") %>

### <a id="retrieve-credentials"></a> Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials

<%# Find this partial in GitHub at `pivotal-cf/docs-partials` %>
<%= partial "/pcf/core/#{vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-')}/backup-restore/bosh_retrieve_credentials" %>

### <a id="retrieve-address"></a> Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address

To retrieve the IP address of your BOSH Director from the BOSH Director tile:

<%# Find this partial in GitHub at `pivotal-cf/docs-partials` %>
<%= partial "/pcf/core/#{vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-')}/backup-restore/bosh_target_director_bbr" %>

### <a id='check-director'></a> Step 5: Check Your BOSH Director

This section describes the procedures you must perform to confirm that your BOSH Director is reachable and can be backed up.

#### <a id='connect-jumpbox'></a> Connect to Your Jumpbox

You can establish a connection to your jumpbox in one of the following ways:

* [Option 1: Connect with SSH](#ssh)
* [Option 2: Connect with BOSH&#95;ALL&#95;PROXY](#bosh-all-proxy)

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> These procedures require that you have a jumpbox configured for SSH access. If you do not have a jumpbox, see <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/jumpbox/">Enabling SSH Access</a> and <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-tunnel/">Tunneling</a> in the BOSH documentation.</p>

<a id='ssh'></a> **Option 1: Connect with SSH**

To connect to your jumpbox with SSH, perform one of these steps:

* If you are using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM as your jumpbox, log in to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM. For more information, see [Log in to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM with SSH](../trouble-advanced.html#ssh) in _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_.

* To connect to your jumpbox using the command line, run:

    ```
    ssh -i PATH-TO-KEY JUMPBOX-USERNAME@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS
    ```
    Where:
    * `PATH-TO-KEY` is the local path to your private key file for the jumpbox host.
    * `JUMPBOX-USERNAME` is your jumpbox username.
    * `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the IP address or hostname of the jumpbox.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you connect to your jumpbox with SSH, you must run the BBR commands in this topic from within your jumpbox.</p>

<a id='bosh-all-proxy'></a> **Option 2: Connect with BOSH&#95;ALL&#95;PROXY**

You can use the environment variable `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` to open an SSH tunnel with SOCKS5 to the jumpbox. This tunnel enables you to forward requests from your local machine to the BOSH Director through the jumpbox. When `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` is set, the BBR CLI uses its value to forward requests to the BOSH Director.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For the following procedures to work, ensure the SOCKS port is not already in use by a different tunnel or process.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Using <code>BOSH_ALL_PROXY</code> can result in longer backup and restore times due to network performance degradation. All operations must pass through the proxy, so moving backup artifacts might be significantly slower.</p>

To connect with `BOSH_ALL_PROXY`, perform one of the following procedures:

* Establish the tunnel separately from the BOSH CLI.
* Establish the tunnel using the BOSH CLI.

To establish the tunnel separately from the BOSH CLI:

1. Establish the tunnel and make it available on a local port by running:

    ```
    ssh -4 -D SOCKS-PORT -fNC JUMPBOX-USERNAME@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS -i JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE -o ServerAliveInterval=60
    ```
    Where:
      * `SOCKS-PORT` is the local SOCKS port.
      * `JUMPBOX-USERNAME` is your jumpbox username.
      * `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the IP address or hostname of the jumpbox.
      * `JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE` is the local SSH private key for accessing the jumpbox.
1. Provide the BOSH CLI with access to the tunnel using the `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` environment variable by running:

    ```
    export BOSH_ALL_PROXY=socks5://localhost:SOCKS-PORT
    ```
    Where is `SOCKS-PORT` is your local SOCKS port.

To establish the tunnel using the BOSH CLI:

1. Provide the BOSH CLI with the necessary SSH credentials to create the tunnel by running:

    ```
    export BOSH_ALL_PROXY=ssh+socks5://JUMPBOX-USERNAME@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS:SOCKS-PORT?private_key=JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE
    ```
    Where:
      * `JUMPBOX-USERNAME` is your jumpbox username.
      * `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the IP address or hostname of the jumpbox.
      * `SOCKS-PORT` is the local SOCKS port.
      * `JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE` is the local SSH private key for accessing the jumpbox.

    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> In BBR v1.5.0 and earlier, the tunnel created by the BOSH CLI does not include the <code>ServerAliveInterval</code> flag. This might cause your SSH connection to timeout when transferring large artifacts. In BBR v1.5.1, the <code>ServerAliveInterval</code> flag is included. For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore/releases/tag/v1.5.1">bosh-backup-and-restore</a> on GitHub.</p>

#### <a id='check-bosh-director'></a> Check Your BOSH Director

To check your BOSH Director:

1. Run:

    ```
    bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    --username bbr \
    --host HOST \
    pre-backup-check
    ```
    Where:
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, HOST is a URL, such as `https://bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, `HOST` is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` you retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> To enable debug logs, use the optional <code>--debug</code> flag. For more information, see <a href="#logging">Logging</a>.</p>

1. After the pre-backup check succeeds, continue to [Step 6: Confirm Backup Restore Node is Deployed](#backup-restore-node). If the pre-backup check fails, the BOSH Director might not have the correct backup scripts or the connection to the BOSH Director might have failed.

### <a id='backup-restore-node'></a> Step 6: Confirm Backup Restore Node Is Deployed

When BBR backs up <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, it needs a Backup Restore node.

To confirm that the Backup Restore node is deployed:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. Find the **Backup Restore Node** job and check if the **Instances** dropdown is set to `1`.

    <%= image_tag("backup-restore-node.png", alt: "Screenshot of Backup Restore Node dropdowns.
    The menus have the values Automatic: 1, Automatic: 200 GB, and Automatic: micro (cpu: 1, ram: 1 GB, disk: 8)") %>

1. If the **Instances** dropdown is not set to `1`:
  1. Set the **Instances** dropdown to `1`.
  1. Click **Save**.
  1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.
  1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
  1. Review your changes. For more information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](../review-pending-changes.html).
  1. Click **Apply Changes**.

### <a id='identify-deployment'></a> Step 7: Identify Your Deployment

To identify the name of the BOSH deployment:

1. Log in to your BOSH Director.

1. To identify the name of the BOSH deployment, run:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE deployments
    ```
    Where:
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP address you retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the CA for the BOSH Director.

### <a id='check'></a> Step 8: Check Your Deployment

To check that your BOSH Director is reachable and has a deployment that can be backed up:

1. Run:

    ```
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    pre-backup-check
    ```
    Where:
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP address you retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**,
       identity and password, that you retrieved in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name you retrieved in [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the root CA for the BOSH Director. If you are using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM as your jumpbox, the path is `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate`.

1. After the pre-backup check succeeds, continue to [Create Your Backup](#procedure). If the pre-backup check fails, the deployment you selected might not have the correct backup scripts, or the connection to the BOSH Director might have failed.


## <a id='procedure'></a> Create Your Backup

This section describes the procedures for creating your backup with BBR.

### <a id='export'></a> Step 9: Export Installation Settings

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you back up your <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation settings by exporting frequently.

When exporting your installation settings, keep in mind:

* This option is only available after you have deployed at least once.

* Always export your installation settings before following the procedure in [Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> and Import Installation Settings](./restore-pcf-bbr.html#deploy-import) in _Restoring Deployments from Backup with BBR_.

* Exporting your installation settings only backs up the settings you configured in <%= vars.ops_manager %>. It does not back up your VMs or any external MySQL databases.

* Your <%= vars.ops_manager %> settings are encrypted. Ensure you keep track of your Decryption Passphrase, because you need it to restore the <%= vars.ops_manager %> settings.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When exporting installation settings for <%= vars.ops_manager %> v1.12 and later, releases are not included in the output file. Releases are now included in the BOSH Director backup, so the output file is much smaller than in previous <%= vars.ops_manager %> versions.</p>

There are two ways to export <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation settings:

* [Use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI](#export-using-ui)
* [Use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API](#export-using-api)

#### <a id='export-using-ui'></a> Option 1: Use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI

To export your installation settings using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI:

1. From the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard, click your username at the top right navigation.

1. Select **Settings**.

1. Select **Export Installation Settings**.

1. Click **Export Installation Settings**.
    <%= image_tag("settings.png", alt: "Screenshot of Export Installation Settings. Above the Export
    Installation Settings button is the warning: 'Upgrading Ops Manager may block the upgrade path
    for certain products. Please read Upgrading Ops Manager and verify an upgrade path exists for
    your installed products.'") %>

#### <a id='export-using-api'></a> Option 2: Use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API

To automate the backup process, you can use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to export your installation settings.

To export your installation settings using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API:

1. Run:

    ```
    curl https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/installation_asset_collection \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" > installation.zip
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token. For more information, see [Access the API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html#access-api) in _Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API_.

### <a id='bbr-backup-director'></a> Step 10: Back Up BOSH Director

<div class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The time it takes to back up the BOSH Director varies depending on conditions such as network infrastructure and underlying hardware. For large foundations, this step can take a considerable amount of time.</li>
    <li>Because the BBR <code>backup</code> command can take a long time to complete, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends you run it independently of the SSH session so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails. Use <code>nohup</code>, a <code>screen</code>, or a <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

To back up BOSH Director:

1. Run:

    ```
    bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    --username bbr \
    --host HOST \
    backup
    ```
    Where:
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director:
      * If the BOSH Director is public, `HOST` is a URL, such as `https://bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`.
      * If the BOSH Director is not public, `HOST` is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).

    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> To enable debug logs, use the optional <code>--debug</code> flag. For more information, see <a href="#logging">Logging</a>.</p>

If your backup terminates early or fails, you must perform a cleanup.

To clean up:

1. Run:

    ```
    bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    --username bbr \
    --host HOST \
    backup-cleanup
    ```
    Where:
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director:
      * If the BOSH Director is public, `HOST` is a URL, such as `https://bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`.
      * If the BOSH Director is not public, `HOST` is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).

### <a id='bbr-backup'></a> Step 11: Back Up Your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Deployment

<div class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Backing up <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> can take a considerable amount of time, and varies depending on network and hardware infrastructure. In controlled conditions, backup durations were observed to range from a few minutes to several hours. To reduce your backup lock times, consider using selective backups. For more information, see <a href="file-storage-backup-level.html">File Storage Backup Level</a>. Part of the backup process causes downtime for Cloud Controller, during which you cannot push, scale, or delete apps. Your apps are not affected.</li>
    <li>Because the BBR <code>backup</code> command can take a long time to complete, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends you run it independently of the SSH session, so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code>, but you could also run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

To back up your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment:

1. (Optional) If you are not using an internal blobstore or a versioned S3-compatible external blobstore, create a copy of the blobstore with your IaaS-specific tool. Your blobstore backup might be slightly inconsistent with your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> backup depending on the duration of time between performing the backups.

1. Run:

    ```
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    backup
    ```
    Where:
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP address you retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**, or the identity and password, that you retrieved in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name you retrieved in [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the CA for the BOSH Director.
    * To enable debug logs, use the optional `--debug` flag. For more information, see [Logging](#logging).
    * To ensure that BBR downloads your current deployment manifest when backing up, use the optional `--with-manifest` flag. These manifests are included in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> export, but are useful for reference.

1. After the command successfully completes, continue to [Step 12: Transfer Backup Artifacts](#transfer-artifacts). If the command fails:
  1. Run:

        ```
        bbr deployment \
        --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
        --username BOSH-CLIENT \
        --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
        --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
        --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
        backup-cleanup
        ```
        Where:
        * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP address you retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
        * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**, or the identity and password, that you retrieved in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
        * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name you retrieved in [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
        * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the CA for the BOSH Director.
        *  To enable debug logs, use the optional `--debug` flag. For more information, see [Logging](#logging).
        * To ensure that BBR downloads your current deployment manifest when backing up, use the optional `--with-manifest` flag. These manifests are included in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> export, but are useful for reference.
  1. Run the BBR `backup` command again after ensuring that:
      * All the parameters in the command are set.
      * The BOSH Director credentials are valid.
      * The specified deployment exists.


## <a id='after'></a> After Taking Your Backup

This section describes the procedures you must perform after taking your backup.

### <a id='transfer-artifacts'></a> Step 12: Transfer Backup Artifacts

After creating your backup successfully:

1. Move the backup artifacts off the jumpbox to your preferred storage space. The backup created by BBR consists of a directory with the backup artifacts and metadata files. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends compressing and encrypting the files.

1. Make redundant copies of your backup artifacts and store them in multiple locations to minimize the risk of losing backups in the event of a disaster.

1. Attempt to restore every backup to validate the artifacts. For more information, see [Step 13: Validate Your Backup](#validate-backup).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Backup artifacts might contain data covered by European Union regulations. For more information, see <a href="#gdpr">European Union's <em>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em></a>.</p>

### <a id='validate-backup'></a> Step 13: (Optional) Validate Your Backup

After backing up <%= vars.platform_name %>, consider validating your backup by restoring it and checking the apps. BBR is designed for disaster recovery and BBR backups are only compatible with environments matching their source environment's configuration.

<div class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The VMs and disks from the backed-up BOSH Director must not be visible to the new BOSH Director</strong> when validating your backup. As a result, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you deploy the new BOSH Director to a different IaaS network and account than the VMs and disks of the backed-up BOSH Director.</li>
    <li><strong>Data services outside of <%= vars.platform_name %> might produce unexpected side effects during restoration.</strong> Restored apps and services might attempt to connect to data services when you restore to a new environment. For example, consider an app that processes mail queues and connects to an external database. When you validate your backup in a test environment, the app might start processing the queue, and this work might be lost.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### <a id='full-validate'></a> Validate Your Backup in a Second Environment

To spin up a second environment and test the backup:

1. Export your <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation by performing the procedure in [Step 8: Export Installation Settings](#export).

1. Create a new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM in a different network to the original. Ensure that the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM has enough persistent disk to accommodate the files exported in the previous step. For more information, see [IaaS-Specific Deployment Guidelines](../deploy-bosh-om.html#contents) in _Deploying BOSH and <%= vars.ops_manager %>_.

1. Ensure that the restore environment is compatible with the backup. For more information, see [Compatibility of Restore](./restore-pcf-bbr.html#compatibility) in _Restoring Deployments from Backup with BBR_.

1. Follow the procedures in [Restoring Deployments from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html).

#### <a id='ert-validate'></a> Validate Your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Backup Only

For a sandbox or other non-production environment, you can perform an _in-place_ restore of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> only. In this case, you restore the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> backup to the same <%= vars.platform_name %> environment that the backup was created from. For more information, see [Step 12: Redeploy <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-ert) in _Restoring Deployments from Backup with BBR_.


## <a id='logging'></a> Logging

BBR outputs logs to stdout. By default, BBR logs:

* The backup and restore scripts that it finds
* When it starts or finishes a stage, such as pre-backup scripts or backup scripts
* When the process is complete
* When any error occurs

If you require additional logging, use the optional `--debug` flag to print:

* Logs about the API requests made to the BOSH server
* All commands executed on remote instances
* All commands executed on local environment
* Standard in and standard out streams for the backup and restore scripts when they are executed


## <a id='canceling-backup'></a> Cancel a Backup

To cancel a backup:

1. Enter `CTRL-C` to terminate the BBR process and then enter `yes` to confirm.

1. Run the BBR `backup-cleanup` command.
    * For a canceled director backup, run:

        ```
        bbr director \
        --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
        --username bbr \
        --host HOST \
        backup-cleanup
        ```
        Where:
        * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you created from **Bbr Ssh Credentials** in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
        * `HOST` is the address of the BOSH Director:
          * If the BOSH Director is public, `HOST` is a URL, such as `https://bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`.
          * If the BOSH Director is not public, `HOST` is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
    * For a canceled deployment backup, run:

        ```
        bbr deployment \
        --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
        --username BOSH-CLIENT \
        --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
        --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
        --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
        backup-cleanup
        ```
        Where:
        * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP address you retrieved in [Step 4: Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-address).
        * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**, or the identity and password, that you retrieved in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
        * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name you retrieved in [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
        * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the CA for the BOSH Director.
        * To enable debug logs, use the optional `--debug` flag. For more information, see [Logging](#logging).
        * To ensure that BBR downloads your current deployment manifest when backing up, use the optional `--with-manifest` flag. These manifests are included in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> export, but are useful for reference.


## <a id="gdpr"></a> European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Backup artifacts might contain personal and other data covered by the European Union's _General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)_.

For example, a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> backup could contain user email addresses.

As such, handle backup artifacts in accordance with organizational policies and applicable laws as they pertain to security, confidentiality, and privacy.
