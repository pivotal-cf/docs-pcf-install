This topic lists the requirements for installing [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## <a id='general'></a> General Requirements

## <a id="aws"></a>AWS Requirements ##

The following are the minimum resource requirements for maintaining a HA
[Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF)
deployment with Ops Manager and Pivotal Application Service (PAS) on Amazon Web Services infrastructure:

* 3 Elastic Load Balancer
* 1 Relational Database Service. Pivotal recommends at least a db.m3.xlarge instance with 100&nbsp;GB of allocated storage.
* 5 S3 Buckets
* EC2 Instances:
  * 24 t2.micro
  * 4 t2.small
  * 4 t2.medium
  * 5 m4.large
  * 3 m3.xlarge
  * 3 m4.xlarge
  * 3 m3.2xlarge
  * 4 c4.xlarge

  By default, PAS deploys the number of VM instances required to run a highly
  available (HA) configuration of PCF. If you are deploying a test or sandbox PCF that does not require HA, you can scale down the number of instances in your deployment. For information about the number of instances required to run a minimal, non-HA PCF deployment, see [Scaling PAS](../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html).

You must have the following to install PCF on AWS:

* An AWS account that can accommodate the minimum resource requirements for a PCF installation.
* The appropriate region selected within your AWS account. 
For help selecting the correct region for your deployment, see the [AWS documentation about regions and availability zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions-availability-zones).
* The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed on your machine and configured with user credentials that have admin access to your AWS account.
* Sufficiently high instance limits, or no instance limits, on your AWS account. Installing PCF requires more than the default 20 concurrent instances.
* A key pair to use with your PCF deployment. For more information, see the [AWS documentation about creating a key pair](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-keypair.html).
* A registered wildcard domain for your PCF installation. You need this registered domain when configuring your SSL certificate and Cloud Controller.
For more information, see the [AWS documentation about Creating a Server Certificate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ssl-server-cert.html#create-cert).
* An SSL certificate for your PCF domain. This can be a self-signed certificate, but Pivotal recommends using a self-signed certificate for testing and development.
You should obtain a certificate from your Certificate Authority for use in production. 
For more information, see the [AWS documentation about SSL certificates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ssl-server-cert.html).

This documentation provides a general definition of IAM terms and provide best practices to help you manage IaaS users and permissions. 

## <a id="permissions"></a>AWS Permissions Guidelines

Pivotal recommends following the principle of least privilege by scoping
privileges to the most restrictive permissions possible for a given role. See
[AWS Permissions Guidelines](./aws-iaas-user-roles.html) for recommendations on
how to create and scope AWS accounts for PCF.

## <a id='delete-pcf'></a> Delete PCF on AWS ##

You can use the AWS console to remove an installation of all components, but retain the objects in your bucket for a future deployment:
