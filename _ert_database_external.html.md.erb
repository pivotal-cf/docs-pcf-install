To configure external databases for your deployment:

1. Ensure that you have a database instance with the following databases created. The steps vary depending on your database type. For an example procedure, see [Creating Databases for PAS](./create-pas-dbs.html). 
  * `account` 
  * `app_usage_service` 
  * `autoscale`
  * `ccdb`
  * `credhub` 
  * `diego` 
  * `locket` 
  * `networkpolicyserver` 
  * `nfsvolume` 
  * `notifications` 
  * `routing` 
  * `silk` 
  * `uaa` 

1. In PAS, select **Databases**. 

1. Under **Choose the location of your system databases**, select **External Databases**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you configure external databases, you cannot configure an internal database in the <strong>UAA</strong> pane.</p>

1. For **Hostname**, enter the hostname of the database server. If you are installing PCF using Terraform, this value corresponds to the following variable:
  * **AWS Terraform**: `rds_address`
  * **GCP Terraform**: `sql_db_ip`

1. For **TCP Port**, enter the port of the database server. 
  * If you are using GCP CloudSQL, enter `3306`. 
  * If you are installing PCF on AWS using Terraform, enter the value for `rds_port`. 

1. Each component that requires a relational database has two corresponding fields: one for the database username and one for the database password. For each set of fields, specify a unique username that can access this specific database on the database server and a password for the provided username. If you are installing PCF using Terraform, these values correspond to the following variables:
  * **AWS Terraform**: `rds_username` and `rds_password`
  * **GCP Terraform**: `pas_sql_username` and `pas_sql_password`
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that the networkpolicyserver database user has the <code>ALL PRIVILEGES</code> permission.</p>

1. (Optional) To enable TLS for your external databases, paste your CA certificate in the **Database CA Certificate** field.
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> TLS is not currently supported for databases that do not include a matching hostname in their server certificate, e.g. GCP.
