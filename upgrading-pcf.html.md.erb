This topic describes upgrading <%= vars.first_product_name %> to <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Changes:</strong> Read the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/pcf-release-notes/index.html">Release Notes</a> and <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html">Breaking Changes</a> for this release, including the Known Issues sections, before starting the upgrade process.</p>


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The procedure below describes upgrading Pivotal Operations Manager, Pivotal Application Service (PAS), and product tiles.

The apps in your deployment continue to run during the upgrade. However, you cannot write to your deployment or make changes to apps during the upgrade.

For details about how upgrading <%= vars.product_name %> impacts individual PAS components, see [What Happens During PAS Upgrades](../upgrading/understanding-pas.html).


## <a id='jump-upgrade'></a> Jump Upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends upgrading directly to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 from <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.4. For more information, see [Jump Upgrading to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/jump-upgrades.html).

Although you can skip minor versions when upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>, <%= vars.company_name %> does not recommend that you skip minor versions when upgrading <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. Skipping minor versions when upgrading <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> may result in additional breaking changes. To avoid this, upgrade <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to the minor version that directly follows your current version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. To upgrade <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to the next minor release, see [Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> for Upgrades](../upgrading/configuring.html) and [Upgrading <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and Other <%= vars.product_name %> Products](../upgrading/upgrading-products.html).


## <a id="prepare"></a> Task 1: Prepare to Upgrade

## <a id="monitor"></a> (Optional) Task 3: Monitor Upgrade

The following sections describe how to monitor your <%= vars.product_name %> foundation during the upgrade and troubleshoot issues:

* [Check Status and Performance](#status)
* [Check Diego State](#diego)
* [Take Snapshots of Storage Metrics](#storage)
* [Collect Logs](#collect-logs)

###  <a id="status"></a> Check Status and Performance

You can monitor the progress of the upgrade by checking the status of the foundation at various locations.

Pivotal recommends live-monitoring your upgrade with <%= vars.product_name %> Healthwatch, which monitors and alerts on the current health, performance, and capacity of <%= vars.product_name %>. Healthwatch captures, calculates, stores, visualizes, and alerts on <%= vars.product_name %> platform metrics, including:

* BOSH-reported VM metrics
* Runtime component metrics
* [Key Performance Indicators](../monitoring/kpi.html) and [Key Scaling Indicators](../monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html)
* Healthwatch-generated [super metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/metrics.html)

For more information, see the [<%= vars.product_name %> Healthwatch](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/index.html) documentation.

If you are not using <%= vars.product_name %> Healthwatch, you can do some or all of the following to monitor upgrade progress:

* Use the BOSH CLI to check the status of a task, VM, or instance. For more information, see [Check Status Using BOSH CLI](#bosh-cli-status).

* Check app availability.

* Run cf CLI commands.

* Check the availability of the Ops Manager UI.

* If using a network-attached storage (NAS) server, check the server's performance.

* If on vSphere, check vSphere performance.

#### <a id='bosh-cli-status'></a> Check Status Using BOSH CLI

To check the status of a task:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS task TASK-NUMBER
    ```
    Where:
    * `ALIAS` is your BOSH alias.
    * `TASK-NUMBER` is the number of the upgrade task you want to check.

To check the status of a VM:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals
    ```
    Where `ALIAS` is your BOSH alias.

To check the status of an instance:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS instances --ps
    ```
    Where `ALIAS` is your BOSH alias.

### <a id="diego"></a> Check Diego State

You can use the CF Diego Operator Toolkit (cfdot) to check Diego component instance count by current state. For more information, see the [cfdot](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cfdot) repository on GitHub.

### <a id="storage"></a> Take Snapshots of Storage Metrics

You can periodically take snapshots of storage metrics. Pivotal recommends this if you have a large foundation and have experienced storage issues in the past.

###  <a id="collect-logs"></a> Collect Logs

If you encounter problems during upgrade:

1. Collect the following information:
    * All job logs
    * Task debug logs for VM upgrade tasks
    * The installation log from Ops Manager

This information helps determine the cause of upgrade issues.


## <a id="after"></a> Task 4: After Upgrade

The following sections describe how to prepare for use of your new environment, check its health status, and clean up after upgrading your <%= vars.product_name %> deployment:

* [Re-Create BOSH Alias](#bosh-alias)
* [Install New cf CLI](#cf-cli)
* [Check the Health of Your Deployment](#health)
* [Check Resource Settings](#resource-settings)
* [Run BOSH Clean-Up](#bosh-cleanup)

### <a id="bosh-alias"></a> Re-Create BOSH Alias

To log in to BOSH after upgrading <%= vars.product_name %>, you must re-create your alias.

To re-create your alias using BOSH:

1. Go to the [Pivotal Application Service](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime/) download page on Pivotal Network.

1. Click the **CF CLI** download button.

1. Unzip the cf CLI ZIP file containing compressed binaries for the cf CLI.

1. Follow the procedure in the [Install the cf CLI Using a Compressed Binary](../../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html#bin) section of the _Installing the cf CLI_ topic.

### <a id="health"></a> Check the Health of Your Deployment

Check the health of your <%= vars.product_name %> deployment to ensure that all jobs and processes are running as expected.

To check the health of your deployment:

1. Check your system status by running:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME instances --ps
    bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals
    bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME cck --report
    ```
    Where:
    * `ALIAS` is your BOSH alias.
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name of your <%= vars.product_name %> deployment.

1. Push and horizontally scale a test app to test PAS performance.

1. If you are running PAS MySQL as a cluster, run the `mysql-diag` tool to validate health of the cluster. For more information, see the BOSH CLI v2 instructions in [Running mysql-diag](../mysql/mysql-diag.html).

### <a id="resource-settings"></a> Check Resource Settings

If you added custom **VM Type** or **Persistent Disk Type** options, you must ensure that these values are correctly set and were not overwritten.

To check your custom resource settings:

1. Go to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click the Ops Manager tile.

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. Ensure that the values for **VM Type** and **Persistent Disk Type** are correct.

### <a id="bosh-cleanup"></a> Run BOSH Clean-Up
