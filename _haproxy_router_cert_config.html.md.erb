Under **Certificates and Private Key for HAProxy and Router**, you must provide at least one **Certificate and Private Key** name and certificate keypair for HAProxy and Gorouter. The HAProxy and Gorouter are enabled to receive TLS communication by default. You can configure multiple certificates for HAProxy and Gorouter. 
   1. Click the **Add** button to add a name for the certificate chain and its private keypair. This certificate is the default used by Gorouter and HAProxy.
