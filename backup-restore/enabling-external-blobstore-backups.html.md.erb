title: Enabling External Blobstore Backups

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the procedure for enabling external blobstore backups on your Pivotal Elastic Runtime (PCF) installation.

BBR supports both versioned and un-versioned S3-Compatible blobstores, and Azure blobstores. For more information, see [Backup and Restore with External Blobstores](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>To enable external blobstore backups on your Elastic Runtime installation, you need to make sure that the backup prepare node is present. See <a href=backup-pcf-bbr.html#backup-prepare-node>Step 5: Enable Backup Prepare Node</a> in  <em>Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR</em>.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>The following steps require BOSH v2+. Check that you have downloaded the latest version of BOSH CLI. For more information, see <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2/#install">Install</a> in the BOSH documentation.</p>

## <a id="s3-versioned"></a> S3-Compatible Versioned Blobstores

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you enable versioned S3-compatible external blobstore backups, you will need to update your runtime configuration when upgrading to PCF v2.1. Remove <code>s3-versioned-blobstore-backup-restorer</code> from your runtime configuration before upgrading.</p>

###<a id="configuring-versioned-s3"></a> Configuring your versioned S3-compatible blobstore for backups

In order to perform backups of your S3-compatible versioned blobstore, you will need to apply the following configurations:

1. Enable versioning. For more information, see [Enable Versioning on Your S3-Compatible Blobstore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html#enable-s3-versioning) in _Backup and Restore with External Blobstores_.

1. (Optional) Pivotal recommends you enable Cross-Region Replication for your buckets. For more information, see [Enable Replication on Your Versioned S3-Compatible Blobstore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html#enable-s3-versioned-replication) in _Backup and Restore with External Blobstores_.

1. (Optional) Pivotal recommends you include a lifecycle policy rule to delete noncurrent versions after a period of time. Including this policy rule saves storage space and cost. For an example of this rule, see [Example 6: Specifying a Lifecycle Rule for a Versioning-Enabled Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html#lifecycle-config-conceptual-ex6) in the AWS documentation.

###<a id="installing-s3-versioned-addon"></a> Installing the S3 Versioned Backups Add-On

The S3 Versioned Backups Add-On provides the necessary functionality to backup and restore a Pivotal Elastic Runtime installation configured to use an S3 versioned blobstore.

To install the add-on:

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **Pivotal Elastic Runtime** tile.
1. From your browser's address bar, record the Elastic Runtime deployment name from the URL. The deployment name is prefixed with the letters `cf`. For example, in `http://pcf.EXAMPLE-HOST.com/products/cf-3247176589a379f246d1`, the Elastic Runtime deployment name is `cf-3247176589a379f246d1`.
1. Navigate back to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click the **Ops Manager Director** tile.
1. Select the **Credentials** tab.
1. Locate the **Director Credentials**, click on the corresponding **Link to Credentials** and take note of the identity and password.
1. Select the **Status** tab.
1. Record the BOSH Director IP address.
1. Go to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-bosh-backup-and-restore) and download the latest **Blobstore Addon**.
1. Run the following command to copy the release archive to your Ops Manager instance:
  <pre class="terminal">$ scp -i PATH\_TO\_PRIVATE\_KEY
    backup-and-restore-sdk-addon-SEMVER.tar.gz ubuntu@YOUR\_OPS\_MANAGER\_VM\_IP:~</pre>
1. SSH into the Ops Manager instance following the instructions in [SSH Into Ops Manager VM](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).
1. In the Ops Manager VM, authenticate with your BOSH director following the instructions in [Log In to the BOSH Director](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in). Use the Director Credentials and Director IP retrieved at steps 5 and 7.
1. Run the following command to upload the release that you previously downloaded from Pivotal Network.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert
   /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate upload-release backup-and-restore-sdk-addon-SEMVER.tar.gz</pre>
1. Run the following command to confirm that the release upload has succeeded.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert
   /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate releases</pre>
  You should see a `backup-and-restore-sdk-addon-SEMVER` entry.
1. Run the following command to download your current runtime config and save it as `runtime-config.yml`.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert
    /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate runtime-config > runtime-config.yml</pre>
  If you receive an error about a missing runtime config, create an empty file and save it as `runtime-config.yml`.
1. Append the below to the `releases` section of your `runtime-config.yml`.
  <pre>
  releases:
  \# Append the below to the list of releases:
  \- name: backup-and-restore-sdk-addon
      version: \<the-release-version\>
  </pre>

1. Append the appropriate configuration to the `addons` section of your `runtime-config.yml`.
</br>
</br>
Replace the bracketed placeholders in the `droplets`, `packages`, and `buildpacks` sections with the values configured in Ops Manager.
</br>
</br>
Replace the bracketed information in the `include` section with the Elastic Runtime Deployment name you recorded earlier.
<pre>

1. Run the following command to finishing updating the runtime config:
<pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert
  /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate update-runtime-config runtime-config.yml
</pre>

1. Navigate to your **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**. Click **Apply Changes**

## <a id="s3-unversioned"></a> S3-Compatible Unversioned Blobstores

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you enable unversioned S3-compatible external blobstore backups, you will need to update your runtime configuration when upgrading to PCF v2.2. Remove <code>s3-unversioned-blobstore-backup-restorer</code> from your runtime configuration before upgrading.</p>

### <a id="backup-buckets"></a>Configuring your unversioned S3-compatible blobstore for backups

For each bucket in use by your Pivotal Elastic Runtime installation, create a corresponding backup bucket. We recommend that either the backup buckets or copies of them should be in a different region to the live buckets. For more information, see [Enable Backup and Restore of Your Unversioned S3-Compatible Blobstore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html#s3-unversioned).
