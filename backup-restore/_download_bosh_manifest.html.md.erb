1. Install Ruby and the [BOSH CLI Ruby gem](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/bosh-cli.html) on a machine outside of your PCF system deployment.
1. From the Installation Dashboard in Ops Manager, select **Ops Manager Director > Status** and record the IP address listed for the Ops Manager Director.
You access the BOSH Director using this IP address.

1. From the command line, target the BOSH Director using the IP address and credentials that you recorded:


	<pre class='terminal'>
	    $ bosh target 10.0.0.3
	    Target set to `microbosh-1234abcd1234abcd1234'
	    Your username: director
	    Enter password: ********************
	    Logged in as `director'
	</pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If <code>bosh target</code> does not prompt you for your username and password, run <code>bosh login</code>.</p>

1. Run `bosh deployments` to identify the name of the current BOSH deployment:
<pre class='terminal'>
	$ bosh deployments
	+-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
	| Name            | Release(s)               | Stemcell(s)                                     |
	+-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
	| cf-example      | cf-mysql/10              | bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent/2690.3 |
	|                 | cf/183.2                 |                                                 |
	+-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
</pre>

1. Run `bosh download manifest DEPLOYMENT-NAME LOCAL-SAVE-NAME` to download and
save the current BOSH deployment manifest.
You need this manifest to locate information about your databases.
Replace `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` with the name of the current BOSH deployment.
For this procedure, use `cf.yml` as the `LOCAL-SAVE-NAME`.
	
	<pre class='terminal'>
	    $ bosh download manifest cf-example cf.yml
	    Deployment manifest saved to `cf.yml'
	</pre>
