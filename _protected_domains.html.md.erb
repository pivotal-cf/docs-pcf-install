If your <%= vars.product_name  %> deployment uses HAProxy and you want it to receive traffic only from specific sources, configure the following fields:
    * **HAProxy protected domains:** Enter a comma-separated list of domains to protect from unknown source requests.
	* **HAProxy trusted CIDRs:** Optionally, enter a space-separated list of CIDRs to limit which IP addresses from the **HAProxy protected domains** can send traffic to <%= vars.product_name  %>.
