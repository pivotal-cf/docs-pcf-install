title: Enabling External S3 Blobstore Backups

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to enable external blobstore backups in your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment.

External blobstore backups leverage the versioning feature of S3-compatible storage solutions instead of downloading the files stored in the blobstore.

For more information, see [Backup and Restore with External Blobstores](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you enable external blobstore backups, you will need to update your runtime configuration when upgrading to PCF v2.1. Remove <code>s3-versioned-blobstore-backup-restorer</code> from your runtime configuration before upgrading.</p>


## <a id='backup-prepare'></a> Step 1: Enable Backup Prepare Node

To ensure the backup prepare node is deployed on your Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile, see [Enable Backup Prepare Node](backup-pcf-bbr.html#backup-prepare-node) in _Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR_.

## <a id='versioning'></a> Step 2: Set S3 Blobstore Versioning

1. Create buckets for your PAS tile. For more information about creating buckets, see [Create S3 Buckets](../pcf-aws-manual-config.html#create-s3) in _Manually Configuring AWS for PCF_.

1. Enable versioning and replication. For more information, see [Enable Versioning on Your S3-Compatible Blobstore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html#enable-s3-versioning) in _Backup and Restore with External Blobstores_.

1. (Optional) Pivotal recommends you include a lifecycle policy rule to delete noncurrent versions after a period of time. Including this policy rule saves storage space and cost. For an example of this rule, see [Example 6: Specifying a Lifecycle Rule for a Versioning-Enabled Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html#lifecycle-config-conceptual-ex6) in the AWS documentation.

## <a id='backup-prepare'></a> Step 3: Configure an External Blobstore

To configure an external blobstore for your PAS tile with your S3 buckets, see [External S3 or Ceph Filestore](../pcf-aws-manual-er-config.html#external_s3) in the _Manually Configuring PAS for AWS_.


## <a id='backup-prepare'></a> Step 4: Install the S3 Backups Add-On

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click **PAS** tile.
1. From your browser's address bar, record the PAS deployment name from the URL. The deployment name is prefixed with the letters `cf`. For example, in `http://pcf.EXAMPLE-HOST.com/products/cf-3247176589a379f246d1`, the PAS deployment name is `cf-3247176589a379f246d1`. The PAS deployment name value is used to update the runtime config in a later step. 
1. Select the **Credentials** tab.
1. Locate **Director Credentials** and click **Link to Credentials** to retrieve your Director credentials. Record your **Director Credentials**. The **Director Credentials** are used to update the runtime config in a later step. 
1. Select the **Status** tab.
1. Record the BOSH Director IP address. The BOSH Director IP address value is used to update the runtime config in a later step. 
1. Go to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/) and download **BOSH Addon for Backup and Restore of External Blobstores**.
1. Run the following command to copy the release archive to your Ops Manager instance. For more information on obtaining your private key, see [Step 4: Check your BOSH Director
](backup-pcf-bbr.html#check-director) in _Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR_.
  <pre class="terminal">$ scp -i PATH\_TO\_PRIVATE\_KEY 
    BBR-external-blobstore-SEMVER.tar.gz ubuntu@YOUR\_OPS\_MANAGER\_VM\_IP:~</pre>
1. Run the following command to SSH into the Ops Manager instance.
  <pre class="terminal">$ ssh -i PATH\_TO\_PRIVATE\_KEY ubuntu@YOUR\_OPS\_MANAGER\_VM\_IP</pre>
1. In the Ops Manager VM, run the following command to log in to your BOSH Director. When prompted, enter your BOSH Director credentials.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert 
    /FILE-PATH-ROOT-CA-CERTIFICATE login</pre>
1. Run the following command to upload the BOSH Addon for Backup and Restore of External Blobstores release that you previously downloaded from Pivotal Network.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert
   /FILE-PATH-ROOT-CA-CERTIFICATE upload-release BBR-external-blobstore-SEMVER.tar.gz</pre>
1. Run the following command to confirm that the release upload has succeeded.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert
   /FILE-PATH-ROOT-CA-CERTIFICATE releases</pre>
  You should see a `backup-and-restore-sdk-preview` entry.
1. Run the following command to download your current runtime config and save it as `runtime-config.yml`.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate runtime-config > runtime-config.yml</pre>
  If you receive an error about a missing runtime config, create an empty file and save it as `runtime-config.yml`.
1. Append the below to the `releases` section of your `runtime-config.yml`. 
  <pre>
  releases:
  <!-- Append the below to the list of releases: -->
  \- name: backup-and-restore-sdk-preview
      version: &lt;the-release-version&gt;
  </pre>

1. Append the below to the `addons` section of your `runtime-config.yml`.
</br>
</br>
 Replace the bracketed placeholders in the `droplets`, `packages`, and `buildpacks` sections with the values you previously created in [Step 2: Set S3 Blobstore Versioning](../pcf-aws-manual-config.html#create-s3). 
</br>
</br>
 Replace the bracketed information in the `include` section with the PAS Deployment name you recorded earlier.
 <pre>  
  addons:
