To use BBR, you must retrieve and record the following credentials:

* **Bosh Director Credentials**
* **Bbr Ssh Credentials**
* **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**

There are two ways to retrieve BOSH Director credentials:

* Ops Manager Installation Dashboard  
* Ops Manager API

**Option 1: Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**

To retrieve your BOSH Director credentials using the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Click the BOSH Director tile.
1. Click the **Credentials** tab.

1. Locate **Director Credentials**.
    1. Click **Link to Credentials** next to it.
    1. Verify the value of the `identity` field. It should be `director`.
    1. Copy and record the value of the `password` field.

1. Locate **Bbr Ssh Credentials**.
    1. Click **Link to Credentials** next to it.
    1. Copy the value of the `private_key_pem` field.
    1. Run the following command to reformat the copied value, and save it in the current directory to a file named `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE`:
  
        ```
        printf -- "YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY" > PRIVATE-KEY-FILE
        ```

        Where:
        * `YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY` is the text of your private key.
        * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file you are creating. 

        For example:

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ printf --  "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- MIIEkeycontents ----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----" > bbr_key.pem
       </pre>

1. Locate the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**
    1. Click **Link to Credentials** next to it.
    1. Verify the value of the `identity` field. It should be `bbr_client`.  
    1. Record the value of the `password` field.

**Option 2: Ops Manager API**

To retrieve BOSH Director credentials using the Ops Manager API, perform the following steps:

1. Obtain your UAA access token. For more information, see [Access the API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html#access-api).
1. Retrieve the **Director Credentials** by performing the following steps:
    1. Run the following command:  

        ```
        curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/director_credentials" \
        -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
        ```
        Where:  
        * `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.  
        * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.   
    1. Verify the value of the `identity` field. It should be `director`.
    1. Record the value of the `password` field.

1. Retrieve the **Bbr Ssh Credentials** by performing the following steps:
    1. Run the following command:  

        ```
        curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/bbr_ssh_credentials" \
        -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
        ```
        Where:  
        * `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.  
        * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.   
    1. Copy the value of the `private_key_pem` field.
    1. Run the following command to reformat the copied value, and save it in the current directory to a file named `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE`:
  
        ```
        printf -- "YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY" > PRIVATE-KEY-FILE
        ```

        Where:
        * `YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY` is the text of your private key.
        * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file you are creating.

        For example:

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ printf --  "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- MIIEkeycontents ----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----" > bbr_key.pem
        </pre>

1. Retrieve the **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials** by performing the following steps:
    1. Run the following command:  

        ```
        curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/uaa_bbr_client_credentials" \
        -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
        ```
        Where:  
        * `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.  
        * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.
    1. Verify the value of the `identity` field. It should be `bbr_client`.  
    1. Record the value of the `password` field.
