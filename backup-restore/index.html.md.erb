The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect on May 25, 2018 and impacts any company processing the data of EU citizens or residents, even if the company is not EU-based. 
The GDPR sets forth how companies should handle privacy issues, securely store data, and respond to security breaches.

Backup artifacts may contain personal data covered by GDPR. For example, a backup of a PAS could contain a user email. For further information regarding personal data that may be stored in PCF,
