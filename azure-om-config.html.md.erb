This topic describes how to configure the Ops Manager Director for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on Azure.

Before you perform the procedures in this topic, you must have completed the procedures in the [Preparing to Deploy PCF on Azure](azure-prepare-env.html) topic and either the [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on Azure](azure-om-deploy.html) or the [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance with an ARM Template](azure-arm-template.html) topic. 

After you complete the procedures in this topic, follow the instructions in the [Deploying Elastic Runtime on Azure](azure-er-config.html) topic.

## <a id='access-om'></a>Step 1: Access Ops Manager ##

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of Ops Manager that you set up in either the [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on Azure](./azure-om-deploy.html) or the [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance with an ARM Template](azure-arm-template.html) topic. 
1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider (IdP) ###

<%= partial 'using_idp_ops_manager' %> 

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable if lost.
    * If you are using an **Http proxy** or **Https proxy**, follow these [instructions](./pcf-director-proxy-settings.html).
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

## <a id='director-config'></a>Step 3: Director Config Page ##

1. Select **Director Config**.

	<%= image_tag("azure/director-config.png") %>

1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter a comma-separated list of valid NTP servers.

1. (Optional) Enter your **Metrics IP Address** if you are [Using JMX Bridge](use-metrics.html).

1. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** checkbox to enable the Ops
Manager Resurrector functionality and increase Elastic Runtime availability.

1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** to run a post-deploy script after deployment. This script allows the job to execute additional commands against a deployment.

1. Select **Recreate all VMs** to force BOSH to recreate all VMs on the next deploy. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.

1. Select **Enable bosh deploy retries** if you want Ops Manager to retry failed BOSH operations up to five times.

1. (Optional) Select **HM Pager Duty Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with PagerDuty.
    <%= image_tag("images/director_hm_pager.png") %>
    * **Service Key**: Enter your API service key from PagerDuty.
    * **HTTP Proxy**: Enter an HTTP proxy for use with PagerDuty.

1. (Optional) Select **HM Email Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with email.
     <%= image_tag("images/director_hm_email.png") %>
    * **Host**: Enter your email hostname.
    * **Port**: Enter your email port number.
    * **Domain**: Enter your domain.
    * **From**: Enter the address for the sender.
    * **Recipients**: Enter comma-separated addresses of intended recipients.
    * **Username**: Enter the username for your email server.
    * **Password**: Enter the password password for your email server.
    * **Enable TLS**: Select this checkbox to enable Transport Layer Security.

1. For **Blobstore Location**, Pivotal recommends that you keep **Internal** selected. 
     <%= image_tag("azure/blobstore.png") %>

1. For **Database Location**, Pivotal recommends that you keep **Internal** selected.
     <%= image_tag("azure/database.png") %>

1. **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the Ops Manager Director can run simultaneously. Pivotal recommends that you leave the field blank to use the default value unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.
1. Enter a **Director Hostname** to add a custom URL for your BOSH Director host. Make sure you have already set up a DNS entry for this hostname.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='create-networks'></a>Step 4: Create Networks Page ##

1. Select **Create Networks**.

	<%= image_tag("azure/create-networks.png") %>

1. Click **Add Network**.
1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** if you want to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.
1. For **Name**, enter `default`.
1. If you want to dynamically provision VMs in this network for use with on-demand services, select the **Service Networks** checkbox. When the checkbox is selected, Ops Manager does not provision VMs within the specified CIDR range.
1. To create a subnet, complete the following fields:
	* **Azure Network Name**: Enter `pcf-net/pcf`. 
	* **CIDR**: Enter `10.0.0.0/20`.
	* **Reserved IP Ranges**: Enter the first 9 IP addresses of the subnet. For example, `10.0.0.1-10.0.0.9`.
	* **DNS**: Enter `168.63.129.16`.
	* **Gateway**: Enter the first IP address of the subnet. For example, `10.0.0.1`.
1. Click **Save**. If you do not have **Enable ICMP checks** selected, you may see red warnings which you can safely ignore.

## <a id='create-networks'></a>Step 5: Assign Networks Page ##

1. Select **Assign Networks**.
	
	<%= image_tag("azure/assign-networks.png") %>

1. Under **Network**, select the `default` network you created from the dropdown menu.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='security'></a>Step 6: Security Page ##

1. Select **Security**.

    <%= image_tag("om-security.png") %>

1. In **Trusted Certificates**, enter a custom certificate authority (CA) certificate to insert into your organization's certificate trust chain. This feature enables all BOSH-deployed components in your deployment to trust a custom root certificate. If you want to use Docker Trusted Registries for running app instances in Docker containers, use this field to enter your certificate for your private Docker Trusted Registry. See the [Using Docker Trusted Registries](../opsguide/docker-registry.html) topic for more information.
1. Choose **Generate passwords** or **Use default BOSH password**. Pivotal recommends that you use the **Generate passwords** option for greater security.
1. Click **Save**. To view your saved Director password, click the **Credentials** tab.

## <a id='resource-config'></a>Step 7: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.

    <%= image_tag("azure/om-resource-config.png") %>

1. Ensure that the **Internet Connected** checkboxes are selected for all jobs. This gives all VMs a public IP address that enables outbound Internet access.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to provision a Network Address Translation (NAT) box to provide Internet connectivity to your VMs instead of providing them with public IP addresses, deselect the <strong>Internet Connected</strong> checkboxes. Azure offers a managed <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/load-balancer-overview/">source NAT (SNAT) service</a>. However, Pivotal does not recommend using this service because Elastic Runtime deployments may fail due to SNAT performance bottlenecks.</p> 

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields,
choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='complete-installation'></a>Step 8: Complete the Ops Manager Director Installation

1. Click **Apply Changes**. If a red ICMP error message appears and you have disabled ICMP, click
**Ignore errors and start the install**.

1. Ops Manager Director installs. This may take a few moments. When the installation process successfully completes, the **Changes Applied** window appears.

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Elastic Runtime for Azure](azure-er-config.html) topic.
