<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes using the BOSH CLI to help diagnose and resolve issues with your [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) deployment. Before using the information and techniques in this topic, you might want to review the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.html).

To follow the steps in this topic, you must log in to the BOSH Director. The BOSH Director runs on the virtual machine (VM) that Ops Manager deploys on the first install of the Ops Manager Director tile.

After authenticating into the BOSH Director, you can run specific commands using the BOSH Command Line Interface (BOSH CLI). BOSH Director diagnostic commands have access to information about your entire [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) installation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before running any BOSH CLI commands, verify that no BOSH Director tasks are running on the Ops Manager VM. See the <em>Tasks</em> section of <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2#task-mgmt">BOSH CLI commands</a> for more information.</p>

## <a id='gather'></a>Gather Credential and IP Address Information ##

Before you begin troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI, follow the instructions below to collect the information you need from the Ops Manager interface.

1. Open the Ops Manager interface by navigating to the Ops Manager fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in a web browser. 

1. Click the **Ops Manager Director** tile and select the **Status** tab.

1. Record the IP address for the Director job. This is the IP
address of the VM where the BOSH Director runs.

1. You see a login confirmation. For example:

    <pre class='terminal'>Logged in as admin@example.org
    </pre>

## <a id='cli'></a>Use the BOSH CLI for Troubleshooting

This section describes three BOSH CLI commands commonly used during
troubleshooting.

* **VMs**: Lists the VMs in a deployment
* **Cloud Check**: Runs a cloud consistency check and interactive repair
* **SSH**: Starts an interactive session or executes commands with a VM

### <a id='vms'></a>BOSH VMs

The `bosh2 vms` command provides an overview of the virtual machines that BOSH manages.

To use this command, run `bosh2 -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT vms`. Replace `MY-ENV` with your environment, and `MY-DEPLOYMENT` with a deployment. `-d MY-DEPLOYMENT` is optional.

When troubleshooting an issue with your deployment, `bosh2 vms` may show a VM in
an **unknown** state.
Run [bosh2 cloud-check](#cck) on a VM in an **unknown** state to instruct BOSH to
diagnose problems with the VM.

You can also run `bosh2 vms` to identify VMs in your deployment, then use the
[bosh2 ssh](#ssh) command to SSH into an identified VM for further 
troubleshooting.

`bosh2 vms` supports the following arguments:

* `--dns`: Report also includes the DNS A record for each VM
* `--vitals`: Report also includes load, CPU, memory usage, swap usage, system disk usage, ephemeral disk usage, and persistent disk usage for each VM

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Status</strong> tab of the <strong>Elastic Runtime</strong> product tile displays information similar to the <code>bosh2 vms</code> output.</p>

### <a id='cck'></a>BOSH Cloud Check

Run the `bosh2 cloud-check` command to instruct BOSH to detect differences
between the VM state database maintained by the BOSH Director and the actual
state of the VMs. For each difference detected, `bosh2 cloud-check` can offer the
following repair options:

* `Reboot VM`: Instructs BOSH to reboot a VM. Rebooting can resolve many
  transient errors.
* `Ignore problem`: Instructs BOSH to do nothing.
  You may want to ignore a problem in order to run `bosh2 ssh` and attempt
  troubleshooting directly on the machine.
* `Reassociate VM with corresponding instance`: Updates the BOSH Director state
  database.
  Use this option if you believe that the BOSH Director state database is in
  error and that a VM is correctly associated with a job.
* `Recreate VM using last known apply spec`: Instructs BOSH to destroy the
  server and recreate it from the deployment manifest that the installer
  provides. Use this option if a VM is corrupted.
* `Delete VM reference`: Instructs BOSH to delete a VM reference in the
  Director state database. If a VM reference exists in the state database, BOSH
  expects to find an agent running on the VM.
  Select this option only if you know that this reference is in error.
  Once you delete the VM reference, BOSH can no longer control the VM.

To use this command, run `bosh2 -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT cloud-check`. Replace `MY-ENV` with your environment, and `MY-DEPLOYMENT` with your deployment.

####Example Scenarios ####

**Unresponsive Agent**

<pre class='terminal'>
  $ bosh2 -e example-env -d example-deployment cloud-check
  ccdb/0 (vm-3e37133c-bc33-450e-98b1-f86d5b63502a) is not responding:

  - Ignore problem
  - Reboot VM
  - Recreate VM using last known apply spec
  - Delete VM reference (DANGEROUS!)
</pre>

**Missing VM**

<pre class='terminal'>
  $ bosh2 -e example-env -d example-deployment cloud-check
  VM with cloud ID `vm-3e37133c-bc33-450e-98b1-f86d5b63502a' missing:

  - Ignore problem
  - Recreate VM using last known apply spec
  - Delete VM reference (DANGEROUS!)
</pre>

</pre>

**Out of Sync VM**

<pre class='terminal'>
  $ bosh2 -e example-env -d example-deployment cloud-check
  VM `vm-3e37133c-bc33-450e-98b1-f86d5b63502a' is out of sync:
  expected `cf-d7293430724a2c421061: ccdb/0', got `cf-d7293430724a2c421061: nats/0':

  - Ignore problem
  - Delete VM (unless it has persistent disk)
</pre>

### <a id='bosh-ssh'></a>BOSH SSH

Use `bosh2 ssh` to SSH into the VMs in your deployment.

Follow the steps below to use `bosh2 ssh`:

1. Identify a VM to SSH into. Run `bosh2 -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT vms` to list the VMs in the given deployment. Replace `MY-ENV` with your environment alias and `MY-DEPLOYMENT` with the deployment name.

1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT ssh VM-NAME/GUID`. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e example-env -d example-deployment ssh diego-cell/abcd0123-a012-b345-c678-9def01234567</pre>
