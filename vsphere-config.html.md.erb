<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to configure the BOSH Director for VMware vSphere.

* Before you begin this procedure, you must complete all steps in [Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to vSphere](./deploying-vm.html).
* After you complete this procedure, follow the configuration instructions for the runtime you choose to install. For example, to install Pivotal Application Service (PAS), see [Deploying PAS on vSphere](./config-er-vmware.html).

See [Installing Runtimes](./runtimes.html) for more information about Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) runtimes.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see <a href="ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a>.</p>


## <a id="set-up"></a> Step 1: Set Up Ops Manager

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.
    * [SAML Identity Provider](#saml): If you use a SAML Identity Provider (IdP), an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [LDAP Server](#ldap): If you use a LDAP Server, an external identity server maintains your user database.


    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='internal'></a> Internal Authentication

1.  When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](./pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created in the previous step.

    <%= image_tag("cf-login.png") %>

### <a id='saml'></a> SAML Identity Provider

<%= partial 'using_saml_idp_ops_manager' %>

### <a id='ldap'></a> LDAP Server

<%= partial 'using_ldap_server_ops_manager' %>


## <a id='vcenter-config'></a> Step 2: vCenter Configs Page

Configure the one or more vCenters that host your PCF foundation. Use the **Add vCenter Config** option to configure multiple datacenters, which supports spreading instances across regions within a single PCF foundation.

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile.

    <%= image_tag("director-tile-vmware.png") %>

1. Select **vCenter Configs**.

    <%= image_tag("vcenter-config.png") %>

1. Enter the following information:
    * **Name**: A name you provide for your vCenter configuration.
    * **vCenter Host**: The hostname of the vCenter that manages ESXi/vSphere.
    * **vCenter Username**: A vCenter username with create and delete privileges for virtual machines (VMs) and folders.
    * **vCenter Password**: The password for the vCenter user specified above.
    * **Datacenter Name**: The name of the datacenter as it appears in vCenter.
    * **Virtual Disk Type**: The Virtual Disk Type to provision for all VMs. For guidance about the virtual disk type to select, see [Provisioning a Virtual Disk in vSphere](./disk-format.html).
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The following fields do not allow whitespace. Including whitespace characters in datastore or datastore folder names causes an error.</p>
    * **Ephemeral Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store ephemeral VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
    * **Persistent Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store persistent VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
    * **VM Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder where Ops Manager places VMs. This defaults to `pcf_vms`.
    * **Template Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder where Ops Manager places VMs. This defaults to `pcf_templates`.
    * **Disk path Folder**: The vSphere datastore folder where Ops Manager creates attached disk images. This defaults to `pcf_disk`. You must not nest this folder.

1. Select a network configuration from one of the following:
    * **Standard vCenter Networking**: This is the default option when upgrading Ops Manager.
    * **NSX Networking**: Select this option to enable VMware NSX Network Virtualization.

    <%= image_tag("NSXdirectorconfig.png") %>

1. Configure NSX networking by entering the following information:
    * **NSX Mode**: Select either **NSX-V** or **NSX-T**.
    * **NSX Address**: The address of the NSX manager.
    * **NSX Username**: The username to connect to the NSX manager.
    * **NSX Password**: The password for the username specified above.
    * **NSX CA Cert**: A CA certificate in PEM format that authenticates to the NSX server.
    If the NSX Manager generated a self-signed certificate, use the following command to retrieve the CA certificate using OpenSSL: `openssl s_client -showcerts -connect NSX-MANAGER-ADDRESS:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509`
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To update NSX security group and load balancer information, see <a href="./update-nsx.html">Updating NSX Security Group and Load Balancer Information</a>.</p>

1. Click **Save**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After your initial deployment, you cannot edit the VM Folder, Template Folder, and Disk path Folder names.</p>

1. (Optional) Click **Add vCenter Config** toward the top of the form to configure additional vCenters. Once you click **Save**, your multiple vCenter Configs are listed in the **vCenter Configs** pane. For more information about multiple vCenter configs, see [Managing Multiple Data Centers](./multiple-datacenters.html).


## <a id='dir-config'></a> Step 3: Director Config Page

<%= partial "director-config" %>

## <a id='create-az'></a> Step 4: Create Availability Zone Page

An Ops Manager availability zone (AZ) corresponds to your vCenter clusters and resource pools.

Multiple AZs allow you to provide high-availability and load balancing to your applications. When you run more than one instance of an application, Ops Manager balances those instances across all of the AZs assigned to the application.

Pivotal recommends that you use at least three AZs for a highly available installation of your chosen runtime.

1. Select **Create Availability Zones** to navigate to the pane.

    <%= image_tag("create-az.png", :alt => "The 'Create Availability Zones' pane shows a list of two availability zones: 'first-az' and 'second-az' with a button to the right to 'Add'. The 'first-az' is expanded and shows the fields 'Name' and 'IaaS Configuration'. Below that, still in the expanded 'first-az', a subhead called 'Clusters' lists a group of two fields, 'Cluster' and 'Resource Pool' with a button to the right to 'Add Cluster'.") %>

1. Use the following steps to create one or more AZs for your applications to use:
    * Click **Add**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the AZ.
    * Select a vCenter config name from the **IaaS Configuration** dropdown to associate your AZ with a vCenter. If you have only one vCenter config or if you are creating your first AZ, **IaaS Configuration** defaults to the first vCenter and cannot be configured.
    * Enter the name of an existing vCenter **Cluster** to use as an AZ.
    * **(Optional)** Enter the name of a **Resource Pool** in the vCenter cluster that you specified above. The jobs running in this AZ share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    * **(Optional)** Click **Add Cluster** to create another set of **Cluster** and **Resource Pool** fields. You can add multiple clusters. Click the trash icon to delete a cluster. The first cluster cannot be deleted.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For more information about using availability zones in vSphere, see <a href="./understand-az.html">Understanding Availability Zones in VMware Installations</a>.</p>

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='create-networks'></a> Step 5: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.

    <%= image_tag("create-network.png") %>

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.

1. Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network.
    * Enter the full path and **vSphere Network Name** as it displays in vCenter. For example, enter `YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME/YOUR-NETWORK-NAME`. If your vSphere Network Name contains a forward slash character, replace the forward slash with the URL-encoded forward slash character `%2f`.
    * For **CIDR**, enter a valid CIDR block in which to deploy VMs. For example, enter `192.0.2.0/24`.
    * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **CIDR**
    that you want to blacklist from the installation. Ops Manager will not deploy VMs to any address in this range.
    * Enter your **DNS** and **Gateway** IP addresses.
    * Select which **Availability Zones** to use with the network.

1. Click **Save**.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Multiple networks allow you to place vCenter on a private network and the rest of your deployment on a public network. Isolating vCenter in this manner denies access to it from outside sources and reduces possible security vulnerabilities.

## <a id='assign-azs'></a> Step 6: Assign AZs and Networks Page

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**.
<%= image_tag("assign-az.png") %>

1. Use the dropdown to select a **Singleton Availability Zone**. The BOSH Director installs in this Availability Zone.

1. Use the dropdown to select a **Network** for your BOSH Director.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='security-config'></a> Step 7: Security Page

<%= partial "security-pane" %>

## <a id='syslog'></a> Step 8: Syslog Page

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> BOSH Director logs contain sensitive information that should be considered privileged. For example, these logs may contain cloud provider credentials. If you choose to forward logs to an external syslog endpoint, use TLS encryption to prevent information from being intercepted by a third party.</p>

<%= partial 'syslog_bosh' %>

## <a id='resource-config'></a> Step 9: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.

    <%= image_tag("vsphere-om-resources.png") %>

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields, choose **Automatic** from the dropdown to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager requires a Director VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id="custom-vm-extensions"></a> Step 10: (Optional) Add Custom VM Extensions

<%= partial "vm-extension-config"  %>

## <a id='complete-installation'></a> Step 11: Complete the BOSH Director Installation

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** on the right navigation.

1. After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in [Deploying PAS on vSphere](config-er-vmware.html).
