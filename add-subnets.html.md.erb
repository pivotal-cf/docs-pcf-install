This topic describes how to add more than one subnet to each network using the BOSH Director.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

You can add more than one subnet to each network using the BOSH Director. After successfully deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.1 or later, you can expand your network with multiple, overlapping availability zones (AZs). You may want to create subnets with overlapping AZs if your current subnet is full and you determined your network needs expansion.
