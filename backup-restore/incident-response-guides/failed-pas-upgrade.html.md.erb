This topic explains how to use BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) to restore <%= vars.ops_manager %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) back to a healthy state after a failed upgrade between <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> minor versions.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> BBR can only restore across the same <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> minor versions. To verify which version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> was used to create the backup artifact, see <code>metadata/cf-VERSION.yml</code> in the backup artifact.</p>


## <a id="evaluate"></a> Evaluate Your Deployment

You can restore <%= vars.ops_manager %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to a healthy state after a failed upgrade between <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> minor versions if your backups, BOSH Director, and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment meet certain conditions. Follow the procedures in this section to confirm that your deployment can be restored by BBR.

### <a id="review-backup"></a> Review Your Backup

Before you perform a restore, you must:

1. Run the following `bbr` commands from your <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM:
  * Back up your deployments by running:

        ```
        bbr deployment --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME backup
        ```
        Where `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name of your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment.
  * Back up your BOSH Director by running:

        ```
        bbr director backup
        ```
        The above `bbr` commands produce the following backup artifacts:

        * `DEPLOYMENT_NAME_TIMESTAMP/`
        * `DIRECTOR_IP_TIMESTAMP/`
        * `installation.zip`

1. Export your <%= vars.ops_manager %> settings. For more information, see [Settings Page](../../pcf-interface.html#settings) in _Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Interface_.

### <a id="validating-environment-restore"></a>Validate Your Environment for Restore

Before you can restore after a failed upgrade between <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> minor versions, you must confirm that your BOSH Director and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment are healthy.

#### <a id="bosh-director"></a>Confirm That Your BOSH Director Is Healthy

To check that the BOSH Director is in a healthy state for a `bbr restore`, SSH to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM and ensure that all jobs are running.

To ensure that all jobs are running:

1. SSH into your BOSH Director. For more information, see [Log In to the BOSH Director VM with SSH](../../trouble-advanced.html#bosh-director-ssh) in _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_.

1. View all deployment job instances by running:

    ```
	  monit summary
	  ```
    Monit should report that all jobs are `running`.

1. Ensure that the BOSH API is responsive by running the following command:

    ```
  	bosh configs
  	```
    If this command runs successfully, then the BOSH Director API is in a healthy
    and responsive state and can be restored by BBR.

If your BOSH Director is unhealthy, see [Restoring an Unhealthy BOSH Director](#unhealthy-bosh).

#### <a id="pas"></a> Confirm That Your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Deployment Is Healthy

To confirm that <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> is in a healthy state:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME instances
    ```
    Where `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name of your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> BOSH deployment.
    <br>
    <br>
    If your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment is healthy, then the output states that all of your instances are in the `running` state. If all instances are running, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> can be restored by BBR.
    <br>
    <br>
    If your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment is unhealthy, see [Restoring an Unhealthy <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Deployment](#unhealthy-pas).


## <a id="restore"></a> Restore Your Deployment

After you confirm that your BOSH Director is healthy with its data intact, and all instances in your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment are responsive, you can restore <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> with BBR.

### <a id="healthy-bosh-healthy-pas"></a> Restoring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>

If your BOSH Director is healthy, you can restore across the same <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> minor version by following the procedures in [Step 14: Restore <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](../restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-ert)
in _Restoring Deployments from Backup with BBR_.


## <a id="recover"></a> Recover to a Healthy State

If either the BOSH Director or <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> are not in a healthy state, they must be recovered before you can run `bbr restore`. If you need guidance on the following subsections, contact [Support](https://support.pivotal.io/).

### <a id="unhealthy-bosh"></a> Restoring an Unhealthy BOSH Director

If the BOSH Director is not in a healthy state, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends following the full restore workflow to regain your <%= vars.ops_manager %>, BOSH Director, and BOSH deployments. For more information, see [Restore Workflow](../restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-diagram) in _Restoring Deployments from Backup with BBR_.

### <a id="unhealthy-pas"></a> Restoring an Unhealthy <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Deployment

If your BOSH Director is healthy, you can restore your previous BOSH Director state by following the procedure in [Step 8: Restore the BOSH Director](../restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-bosh) in _Restoring Deployments from Backup with BBR_.

After your BOSH Director is restored, you can then restore your deployments by following the procedure in [Step 14: Restore <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](../restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-ert) in _Restoring Deployments from Backup with BBR_.
