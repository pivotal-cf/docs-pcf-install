This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on Azure.

To view production-level deployment options for PCF on Azure, see the [Reference Architecture for Pivotal Cloud Foundry on Azure](../refarch/azure/azure_ref_arch.html).

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites ##

The following sections describe general requirements for running PCF and specific requirements for running PCF on Azure.

### <a id="azure"></a>Azure Requirements ##

The following are the minimum resource requirements for maintaining a PCF deployment with Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime on Azure:

* VMs:
	* 27 F1s
	* 4 F2s
	* 4 F4s
	* 1 DS11v2
	* 1 DS12v2
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The F-series is not supported in North Central US, East Asia, Japan East, Australia East, and Australia Southeast. The DSv2-series is not supported in East Asia. If you are deploying PCF in one of these regions, see the <a href="http://opsman-dev-api-docs.cfapps.io/#overriding-defaults-with-custom-disk-types">Ops Manager API documentation</a> for instructions on how to override the default VM sizes. Changing the default VM sizes may increase the cost of your deployment.</p>

* An OS disk of 120 GB for the Ops Manager VM

* An Azure subscription that can accommodate a public IP address for each VM
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: By default, Azure sets an upper limit of 60 public IP addresses. Depending on the size of your deployment, you may need to increase this limit by submitting an Azure support ticket. For more information, see the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/billing-how-to-create-billing-support-ticket/">Azure documentation</a>.</p>

* To deploy PCF on Azure, you must have the Azure CLI v0.10.5 or higher. For instructions on how to install the Azure CLI for your operating system, see [Preparing to Deploy PCF on Azure](azure-prepare-env.html#install_cli).
