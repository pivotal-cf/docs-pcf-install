<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<% $this_topic = 'backup-pcf' %>

This topic describes the procedure for backing up your critical backend Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) components with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR), a command-line tool for backing up and restoring BOSH deployments. To restore your backup, see the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

To view the BBR release notes, see the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/bbr/bbr-rn.html">BOSH Backup and Restore Release Notes</a>.

During the backup, BBR stops the Cloud Controller API and the Cloud Controller workers to create a consistent backup. Only the API functionality, like pushing applications or using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) are affected. The deployed applications do not experience downtime.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can only use BBR to back up PCF v1.11 and later. To back up earlier versions of PCF, perform the <a href="backup-pcf.html">manual procedures</a>.</p>

<div class="note warning">
  <strong>Warnings</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Backup artifacts can contain secrets.</strong> Secure backup artifacts by using encryption or other means. </li>
    <li><strong>The restore is a destructive operation.</strong> BBR is designed to restore PCF after a disaster. If it fails, the environment may be left in an unusable state and require reprovisioning. The two restore scenarios currently documented are <a href="restore-pcf-bbr.html">Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR</a> and <a href="in-place-restore.html">Restoring a PAS Backup In-Place</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>The Cloud Controller API will stop sending and receiving calls</strong> for the duration of PCF restoration.</li>
    <li><strong>BBR does not back up any service data.</strong></li>
  </ul>
</div>

##<a id='recs'></a> Recommendations

Pivotal recommends the following:

* Follow the full procedure documented in this topic when creating a backup. This ensures that you always have a consistent backup of Ops Manager and PAS to restore from.
* Back up frequently, especially before making any changes to your PCF deployment, such as the configuration of any tiles in Ops Manager.

## <a id="restore-compatibility"></a> Compatibility of Restore

When using a backup to restore, you must ensure that the restore environment is compatible. For more information, see [Compatibility of Restore](./restore-pcf-bbr.html#compatibility).

## <a id='supported'></a>Supported Components

BBR is a binary that can back up and restore BOSH deployments and BOSH Directors. BBR requires that the backup targets supply scripts that implement the backup and restore functions.

BBR backs up the following PCF components:

* **PAS**: PAS must be configured with either an internal MySQL database or a [supported external database](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/cf-backup.html#supported-external-databases) plus a WebDAV/NFS blobstore. BBR does not support PAS with an external blobstore.

  <ul class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: The following guidelines apply when you are using BBR to back up PCF and have configured an external blobstore and/or unsupported external database in PAS:<ul>
    <li> If you configured an internal database and an external blobstore in PAS, then follow the PCF backup process, and copy the external blobstore via the IaaS. There may be inconsistencies between the blobstore and database, which may result in some apps not coming up during a restore. Those apps can be repushed. </li>
    <li>If you configured an unsupported external database and an external blobstore in PAS, then follow the PCF backup process, but skip the backup of PAS. Copy the external database and blobstore via the IaaS. There may be inconsistencies  between the blobstore and database, which may result in some apps not coming up during a restore. Those apps can be repushed.</li></ul></ul>

* **BOSH Director**: The BOSH Director must have an internal Postgres database to be backed up and restored with BBR. As part of backing up the BOSH Director, BBR backs up the BOSH UAA database and the CredHub database.

### Backing Up Services

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: BBR does <strong>not</strong> currently back up any service data.</p>

Keep in mind the following when backing up services:

* You can back up and restore brokered services with the procedures documented in this topic and in the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html) topic. BBR backs up and restores the VMs and the service instances, but not the service data.
* You can redeploy on-demand service instances manually during restore, but the data in the instance is not backed up.
* BBR does not back up managed services or their data.

## <a id='workflow'></a>Workflow

Operators download the BBR binary and transfer it to a jumpbox. Then they run BBR from the jumpbox, specifying the name of the BOSH deployment to back up.

BBR examines the jobs in the BOSH deployment, and triggers the scripts in the following stages:

1. **Pre-backup lock**: The pre-backup lock scripts locks the job so backups are consistent across the cluster.
1. **Backup**: The backup script backs up the release.
1. **Post-backup unlock**: The post-backup unlock script unlocks the job after the backup is complete.

Scripts in the same stage are all triggered together. For instance, BBR triggers all pre-backup lock scripts before any backup scripts. Scripts within a stage may be triggered in any order.

The backup artifacts are drained to the jumpbox, where the operator can transfer them to storage and use them to restore PCF.

The following diagram shows a sample backup flow.

Before using BBR, follow the instructions in the [Setting up your system for BBR](system-setup-bbr.html) section.

## <a id='prepare'></a>Prepare to Create Your Backup

### <a id='setup-jumpbox'></a>Step 1: Set Up Your Jumpbox

Prepare your jumpbox for BBR by following the steps in the [Setting Up Your Jumpbox for BBR](system-setup-bbr.html) topic.

### <a id='encrypt-key'></a>Step 2: Record the Cloud Controller Database Encryption Credentials

Perform the following steps to retrieve the Cloud Controller Database encryption credentials from the PAS tile:

1. Navigate to Ops Manager in a browser and log in to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Select PAS **Credentials** and locate the Cloud Controller section.
1. Record the Cloud Controller **DB Encryption Credentials**.
You must provide these credentials if you contact [Pivotal Support](https://support.pivotal.io) for help
restoring your installation.

	<%= image_tag("ccdb-encrypt-creds.png") %>

### <a id="retrieve"></a> Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials

Perform the following steps to retrieve the IP address of your BOSH Director and the credentials for logging in from the Ops Manager Director tile:

<%= partial 'bosh_target_director_bbr' %>

### <a id='check-director'></a> Step 4: Check your BOSH Director

Perform the following steps to back up your BOSH Director:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Click the Ops Manager tile.
1. Click the **Credentials** tab.
1. Locate **Bbr Ssh Credentials** and click **Link to Credential** next to it.
<br><br>
You can also retrieve the credentials using the Ops Manager API with a GET request to the following endpoint: `/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/bbr_ssh_credentials`. For more information, see the [Using the Ops Manager API](../ops-man-api.html) topic.

1. Copy the value for `private_key_pem`.
1. SSH into your jumpbox:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ ssh JUMPBOX-USER/JUMPBOX-ADDRESS -i YOUR-CERTIFICATE.pem
	</pre>
1. Run the following command to reformat the key and save it to a file named `PRIVATE-KEY` in the current directory, pasting in the contents of your private key for `YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY`:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ printf -- "YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY" > PRIVATE-KEY
  </pre>
1. Run the BBR `pre-backup-check` command from your jumpbox:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ bbr director \
	  --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY \
	  --username bbr \
	  --host HOST \
	  pre-backup-check
	</pre>

	Use the optional `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. See the [Logging](#logging) section for more information.
	<br><br>
	Replace the placeholder values as follows:
	* `PRIVATE-KEY`: This is the path to the private key file you created above.
	* `HOST`: This is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, this is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP`, which you retrieved in the [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve) section.
1. If the pre-backup check succeeds, continue to the [next section](#identify-deployment). If it fails, the Director may not have the correct backup scripts, or the connection to the BOSH Director may have failed.

### <a id='identify-deployment'></a> Step 5: Identify Your Deployment

After logging in to your BOSH Director, run the following command to identify the name of the BOSH deployment that contains PCF:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -e DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE deployments

Name                     Release(s)
cf-example               push-apps-manager-release/661.1.24
                         cf-backup-and-restore/0.0.1
                         binary-buildpack/1.0.11
                         capi/1.28.0
                         cf-autoscaling/91
                         cf-mysql/35
                         ...
</pre>

In the above example, the name of the BOSH deployment that contains PCF is `cf-example`.

### <a id='check'></a> Step 6: Check Your Deployment

Perform the following steps to check that your BOSH Director is reachable and has a deployment that can be backed up:

1. From your jumpbox, run the BBR pre-backup check:
	<pre class="terminal">
  $ BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET=BOSH-PASSWORD \
      bbr deployment \
      --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
      --username BOSH-CLIENT \
      --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
      --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
      pre-backup-check
	</pre>

    Replace the placeholder values as follows:
    <br><br>
    * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD`: From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click **Ops Manager Director**, navigate to the **Credentials** tab, and click **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials** to retrieve the BOSH UAA credentials.<br><br>
    You can also retrieve the credentials using the Ops Manager API with a GET request to the following endpoint: `/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/uaa_bbr_client_credentials`. For more information, see the [Using the Ops Manager API](../ops-man-api.html) topic.<br><br>
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP`: You retrieved this value in the [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve) section.
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME`: You retrieved this value in the [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment) section.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE`: This is the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director. For more information, see [Ensure BOSH Director Certificate Availability](./system-setup-bbr.html#root-ca-cert).

1. If the pre-backup check succeeds, continue to the [next section](#procedure). If it fails, the deployment you selected may not have the correct backup scripts, or the connection to the BOSH Director may have failed.

## <a id='procedure'></a>Create Your Backup

### <a id='export'></a>Step 7: Export Installation Settings

Pivotal recommends that you back up your Ops Manager installation settings by exporting
frequently. This option is only available after you have deployed at least one time.
Always export your installation settings before following the steps in the [Import Installation Settings](./restore-pcf-bbr.html#import) section of the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR](./restore-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

<div class="note">
  <strong>Notes</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>Exporting your installation settings only backs up the settings you configured in Ops Manager. It does not back up your virtual machines (VMs) or any external MySQL databases.</li>
    <li>Ops Manager 1.12 onwards exports installation settings only, so the output is much smaller than in previous Ops Manager versions.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

There are two ways to export the installation settings.

1. If you want to do it through the Ops Manager UI:

    From the **Installation Dashboard** in the Ops Manager interface, click your user name at the top right navigation. Select **Settings**.

    <%= image_tag("settings.png") %>

1. If you prefer to use the command line:

    You can export the Ops Manager installation settings with the [`om` tool](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om):

    ```
    om --target OPSMAN-URL --username OPSMAN-USERNAME --password OPSMAN-PASSWORD --request-timeout 7200 export-installation --output-file om-installation-settings.zip
    ```

### <a id='bbr-backup-director'></a> Step 8: Back Up Your BOSH Director

Run the BBR backup command from your jumpbox to back up your BOSH Director:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bbr director \
  --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY \
  --username bbr \
  --host HOST \
  backup
</pre>

Use the optional `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. See the [Logging](#logging) section for more information.
<br><br>
Replace the placeholder values as follows:

* `PRIVATE-KEY`: This is the path to the private key file you created in [Step 4: Check your BOSH Director](#check-director).
* `HOST`: This is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, this is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP`, which you retrieved in the [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve) section.

<div class="note"><strong>Notes</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>The BOSH Director backup takes at least 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Because the BBR backup command can take a long time to complete, Pivotal recommends you run it independently of the SSH session so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails.<br>Use <code>nohup</code>, a <code>screen</code>, or a <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

If your backup terminates early or fails, you can clean up by running backup-cleanup:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bbr director \
  --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY \
  --username bbr \
  --host HOST \
  backup-cleanup
</pre>
### <a id='bbr-backup'></a> Step 9: Back Up Your PAS Deployment

1.  If you are using an external blobstore, create a copy of the blobstore with your IaaS specific tool. Your blobstore backup may be slightly inconsistent with your PAS backup depending on the duration of time between performing the backups.

1.  If you are using an external blobstore, create a copy of the blobstore with your IaaS specific tool. Your blobstore backup may be slightly inconsistent with your PAS backup depending on the duration of time between performing the backups.

1. Run the BBR backup command from your jumpbox to back up your PAS deployment:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET=BOSH-PASSWORD \
    nohup bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    backup</pre>
    * Use the optional `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. See the [Logging](#logging) section for more information.
    * Use the optional `--with-manifest` flag to ensure that BBR downloads your current deployment manifest when backing up. These manifests are included in the Ops Manager export, but are useful for reference. For example:
      <pre class="terminal">
      $ BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET=BOSH-PASSWORD \
        nohup bbr deployment \
        --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
        --username BOSH-CLIENT \
        --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
        --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
        backup --with-manifest</pre>

<div class="note"><strong>Notes</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>Backing up PAS takes at least 10 minutes and can take considerably longer with larger blobstores or slow network connections. The backup also incurs around 10 minutes of Cloud Controller downtime during which users are unable to push, scale, or delete apps. Your apps will not be affected.</li>
    <li>Because the BBR backup command can take a long time to complete, Pivotal recommends you run it independently of the SSH session, so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code> but you could also run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
    <li>The backup artifact will contain one or more empty UAA tar files. This is an extraneous artifact. The UAA backup is included in the MySQL backup.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

If the command fails, do the following:

1. Run backup-cleanup:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET=BOSH-PASSWORD \
     bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    backup-cleanup</pre>
1. Ensure all the parameters in the command are set.
1. Ensure the BOSH Director credentials are valid.
1. Ensure the specified deployment exists.
1. Consult the [Exit Codes](#exit-codes) section below.

## <a id='after'></a>After Taking the Backups
If the commands complete successfully, perform the following steps:

1. Move the backup artifacts off the jumpbox to your preferred storage space. The backup created by BBR consists of a folder with the backup artifacts and metadata files. Pivotal recommends compressing and encrypting the files.
1. Make redundant copies of your backup and store them in multiple locations to minimize the risk of losing backups in the event of a disaster.
1. Attempt to test restore on every backup to validate it. Perform the procedures in the next step. See [Step 11: Validate Your Backup](#validate-backup).

### <a id='validate-backup'></a> Step 10: (Optional) Validate Your Backup

If you want to validate your backup, follow the instructions that correspond to your use case:

* **Production environments**: [Validate Your Entire Backup](#full-validate)
* **Sandbox and other non-production environments**: [Validate Only Your PAS Backup](#ert-validate)

#### <a id='full-validate'></a> Validate Your Entire Backup

<div class="note warning"><strong>Warnings</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The VMs and disks from the backed-up BOSH Director should not be visible to the new BOSH Director</strong> when validating your backup. As a result, Pivotal recommends that you deploy the new BOSH Director to a different IaaS network and account than the VMs and disks of the backed-up BOSH Director.</li>
    <li><strong>Data services outside of PCF may produce unexpected side effects during restoration.</strong> The services will try to connect to those data services when you restore to a new environment. For example, consider an app that processes mail queues and connects to an external database. When you validate your backup in a test environment, the app may start processing the queue, and this work may be lost.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

After backing up PCF, you may want to validate your backup by restoring it to a similar environment and checking the applications. Because BBR is designed for disaster recovery, its backups are intended to be restored to an environment deployed with the same configuration.

Perform the following steps to spin up a second environment that matches the original in order to test a restore:

1. Export your Ops Manager installation by performing the steps in the [Step 8: Export Installation Settings](#export) section.
1. Create a new Ops Manager VM in a different network to the original. Ensure that the Ops Manager VM has enough persistent disk to accommodate the files exported in the previous step. Consult the topic specific to your IaaS:<br><br>
  * [Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to AWS](../aws-terraform.html)
	* [Manually Configuring AWS for PCF](../pcf-aws-manual-config.html)
	* [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance with an ARM Template](../azure-arm-template.html)
    * [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on GCP](../gcp-om-deploy.html)
    * [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](../openstack-setup.html)
    * [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](../deploying-vm.html)

After you deploy the second environment, follow the instructions in the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

#### <a id='ert-validate'></a> Validate Your PAS Backup Only

For a sandbox or other non-production environment, you can optionally perform an _in-place_ restore of PAS only. In this case, you restore the PAS backup to the same PCF environment that the backup was created from. Follow the procedures in [Restoring an PAS Backup In-place](in-place-restore.html).

## <a id='exit-codes-logging'></a>Exit Codes and Logging

For information about the exit codes returned by BBR and BBR logging, consult the sections below.

### <a id='exit-codes'></a>Exit Codes

The exit code returned by BBR indicates the status of the backup. The following table matches exit codes to error messages.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Error</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>Success</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>General failure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>The pre-backup lock failed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>The post-backup unlock failed. Your deployment may be in a bad state and requires attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>16</td>
<td>The cleanup failed. This is a non-fatal error indicating that the utility has been unable to clean up open BOSH SSH connections to the deployment VMs. Manual cleanup may be required to clear any hanging BOSH users and connections.</td>
</tr>
</table>

If multiple failures occur, your exit code reflects a combination of values. Use bitwise AND to determine which failures occurred.

For example, the exit code `5` indicates that the pre-backup lock failed and a general error occurred.

To check that a bit is set, use bitwise AND, as demonstrated by the following example of exit code `20`:

<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="mi">20</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">1</span>  <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span>    <span class="c1"># false</span>
<span class="mi">20</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">4</span>  <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">4</span>    <span class="c1"># true; lock failed</span>
<span class="mi">20</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">8</span>  <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">8</span>    <span class="c1"># false</span>
<span class="mi">20</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">16</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">16</span>   <span class="c1"># true; cleanup failed</span>
</code>
</pre>

Exit code `20` indicates that the pre-backup lock failed and cleanup failed.

### <a id='logging'></a>Logging

BBR outputs logs to stdout. By default, BBR logs:

* The backup and restore scripts that it finds
* When it starts or finishes a stage, such as pre-backup scripts or backup scripts
* When the process is complete
* When any error occurs

If more logging is needed, use the optional `--debug` flag to print the following information:

* Logs about the API requests made to the BOSH server
* All commands executed on remote instances
* All commands executed on local environment
* Standard in and standard out streams for the backup and restore scripts when they are executed

## <a id='canceling-backup'></a>Cancelling a Backup

If you need to cancel a backup, perform the following steps:

1. Enter `CTRL-C` to terminate the BBR process, then enter `yes` to confirm.
1. Log in to your BOSH Director with the BOSH CLI by performing the procedures in the [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve) section above.
1. Perform the following steps for each `cloud_controller` VM in your deployment:
	1. List the VMs in your deployment:
		<pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e DIRECTOR-IP \
		--ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
		-d DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
		ssh</pre>
	1. Select the VM you want to SSH into.
	1. Run the following command from the VM:
		<pre class="terminal">$ sudo /var/vcap/jobs/cloud-controller-backup/bin/bbr/post-backup-unlock</pre>
1. Run the BBR pre-backup check from your jumpbox by following the steps in the [Step 7: Check Your Deployment](#check) section above. If the command reports that it cannot back up the deployment, SSH onto each VM mentioned in the error using the BOSH CLI and remove the `/var/vcap/store/bbr-backup` directory if present.
