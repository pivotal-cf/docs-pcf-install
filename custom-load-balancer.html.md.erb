title: Using Your Own Load Balancer
owner: Ops Manager

This guide describes how to use your own load balancer and forward traffic to
your Pivotal Application Service (PAS) router IP address.

[Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf)
(PCF) deploys with a single instance of HAProxy for use in lab and test
environments.
Production environments should use a highly-available customer-provided load
balancing solution that does the following:

* Provides load balancing to each of the PCF Router IP addresses
* Supports SSL termination with wildcard DNS location
* Adds appropriate `x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto` HTTP headers to
incoming requests
* Sets an HTTP keepalive connection timeout greater than five seconds.
* (**Optional**) Supports WebSockets

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Application logging with <a href="../devguide/services/log-management.html#loggregator">Loggregator</a> requires WebSockets. To use another logging service, see the <a href="../devguide/services/log-management.html#use">Using Third-Party Log Management Services</a> topic.</p>

For how to install an [F5 Local Traffic Manager (LTM)](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) as a load balancer for PCF and Pivotal Application Service (PAS), see [Configuring an F5 Load Balancer for PAS](./f5-lb.html).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites##

To integrate your own load balancer with PCF, you must ensure the following:

* WebSocket connections are not blocked for Loggregator functionality.
* The load balancer must be able to reach the Gorouter IP addresses.

Follow the instructions below to use your own load balancer.

##<a id='deploy'></a>Step 1: Deploy PCF Installation VM##

Deploy a PCF Installation virtual machine. See the topic [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](../om/vsphere/deploy.html) for more information.

##<a id='register'></a>Step 2: Register PCF IP Address##

In your load balancer, register the IP addresses that you assigned to PCF.

##<a id='configure'></a>Step 3: Configure Pivotal Ops Manager and Ops Manager Director##

Configure your Pivotal Operations Manager and Ops Manager Director as described in [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../installing/index.html), then add PAS.

Do not click **Install** after adding PAS.

##<a id='configure-networking'></a>Step 4: Configure Networking

Complete the **Networking** configuration page in PAS. Load balancer 
configuration in PAS varies depending on which IaaS you are using for 
PCF. See the configuration procedure for your deployment IaaS: 

* [AWS](./pcf-aws-manual-er-config.html#networking)
* [Azure](./azure-er-config.html#networking)
* [GCP](gcp-er-config.html#networking)
* [OpenStack](./openstack-er-config.html#networking)
* [vSphere](./config-er-vmware.html#networking)
