This topic describes key features of the [Pivotal Cloud
Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Operations Manager
interface.


## <a id="installation-dashboard"></a> Installation Dashboard Page

The Installation Dashboard is the central Ops Manager interface for managing your PCF
deployment. It displays the BOSH Director configuration for your IaaS and product tiles
for your PCF deployment.

The following screenshot shows the Installation Dashboard. Each section is labeled with a
red letter. Click the image to see it at full size.

							     Manager Installation
							     Dashboard. For a description
							     of each labeled section, see
							     the list below") %></a>

The following list describes each labeled section of the Installation Dashboard:

- **A**---**Import a Product**: Click this button to add a new product to Ops Manager. You
can download PCF-compatible product files from [Pivotal
Network](https://network.pivotal.io).  * If you have configured a [Pivotal Network
API](../customizing/add-delete.html) token in the **Settings** section of Ops Manager, a
list of the latest versions of already imported products appears automatically.

- **B**---**Delete All Unused Products**: Click this link to delete any unused products.

- **C**---**Installation Dashboard**: Click this link to return to the **Installation
Dashboard** page from other Ops Manager pages.

- **D**---**Stemcell Library**: Click this link to open the **Stemcell Library**. In the
**Stemcell Library** you can import stemcells, stage stemcells, and review your stemcell
version numbers. For more information, see [Importing and Managing
Stemcells](../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).

- **E**---**Change Log**: Click this link to view and search a log of your previous
installations. See the [Change Log Page](#changelog) section of this topic for details.

- **F**---**User Account Menu**: Click the arrow next to your username to view the menu.
Use this menu to navigate to your **Settings** page, view **My Account** to change your
email and password, or log out of the **Installation Dashboard**. See [My
Account](#account_settings) of this topic for details on account information. See the
[Settings Page](#settings) section of this topic for details on available Ops Manager
settings.

- **G**---**Revert**: Click the revert button to return to the previous successful
installation. Any pending changes you have made to the current installation settings will
be lost.

- **H**---**Review Pending Changes**: Click the button to go to the **Review Pending
Changes** page, which organizes pending changes by tile. You are able to enable or disable
each tile to selectively deploy individual tiles and their dependencies. For more
information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](review-pending-changes.html).

- **I**---**Orange Bar**: Indicates that additional configuration for the product tile is
required before deployment. Click the product tile to complete its configuration.

- **J**---**Missing Stemcell Link**: If an imported product is missing a required
stemcell, a **Missing Stemcell** link appears on the tile. Click this link to open the
Stemcell Library. For more information, see [Importing and Managing
Stemcells](../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).

- **K**---**API Docs**: Click this link to go to the Ops Manager API documentation, which
details how you can manage Ops Manager through the API rather than with the user
interface. For more information about the Ops Manager API, see [Using the Ops Manager
API](ops-man-api.html).

Network release dashboard, and all tile metadata from Pivotal Network products, click
**Delete**.

### Proxy Settings 
If you are using a proxy to connect to Ops Manager, update your
**Proxy Settings** by providing a **HTTP proxy**, **HTTPS proxy**, or **No proxy**.

  <%= image_tag("banner-ui.png", :alt => "A teal banner sits at the top of the
          'Settings' page that says 'Attention: By entering text into the UI

Manager UI. For **SSH Banner**, enter the text that appears when an operator shells into
Operations Manager.

assets. When you export an installation, the exported file contains references to the base
VM images, necessary packages, and configuration settings.

Manager. When you select **Yes** and fill the following fields, Ops Manager produces and
sends all Ops Manager logs to the configured syslog endpoint.<%= partial '../om/common/syslog_bosh' %>

  <li><strong>Download activity data</strong>: Downloads a directory containing the config
    file for the installation, the deployment history, and version information.</li>
