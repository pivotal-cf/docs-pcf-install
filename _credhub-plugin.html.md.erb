## <a id='build-tile'></a> Build and Install a Tile

To use the KMS plugin with CredHub deployed with Ops Manager or Pivotal Application Service (PAS),
you must wrap your BOSH release in a tile and install it on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

Perform the following steps:

1. Install the Tile Generator by doing one of the following:
    * Download the Tile Generator binary for your platform from [cf-platform-eng/tile-generator](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/tile-generator/releases/latest) in GitHub, then run the following commands to make it executable and available:

        ```
        chmod +x TILE-BINARY
        mv TILE-BINARY /usr/local/bin/tile
        ```
        Where:
        `TILE-BINARY` is the name of the tile binary file.
        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">
        $ chmod +x tile_darwin-64bit
        $ mv tile_darwin-64bit /usr/local/bin/tile
        </pre>
    * Use Python 2 and [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). Pivotal recommends
that you use Virtualenv environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages. A virtualenv is
a directory containing dependencies for a project. When a virtual environment is active, packages
install into the virtualenv instead of the system-wide Python installation.
<br><br>
To use this method, run the following commands: 

        ```
        virtualenv -p python2 tile-generator-env
        source tile-generator-env/bin/activate
        pip install tile-generator
        ```
        This puts the `tile` and `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>` commands in your `PATH` when the virtualenv is active.
        To deactivate the virtualenv, run the command `deactivate`.

        To upgrade Tile Generator, run `pip install tile-generator --upgrade` with the virtualenv
        activated.

1. Install the [BOSH CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html).

1. From within the root directory of the project for which you want to create a tile, run
`tile init` to initialize the directory as a tile repository. The `tile init` command generates a `tile.yml` file. This file defines the configuration for
your tile.

1. Modify the `tile.yml` as needed. At a minimum, you must enter the path to the BOSH release of the KMS plugin on your local machine in `packages: path`. The following sample `tile.yml` file defines a tile named `Sample CredHub KMS Plugin` that enables the operator to configure the socket endpoint where the plugin listen for CredHub.

	```yaml
	---
	name: sample-credhub-kms-plugin-tile
	icon_file: icon.png
	label: Sample CredHub KMS Plugin
	description: Sample CredHub KMS Plugin

	packages:
	- name: my-release-name
	  type: bosh-release
	  path: releases/MY-BOSH-RELEASE.tgz

	forms:
	- name: plugin-properties
	  label: Plugin Properties
	  description: Configure your plugin
	  properties:
	  - name: socket_endpoint
	    type: string
	    label: Socket Endpoint

	runtime_configs:
	- name: some-runtime-config
	  runtime_config:
	    releases:
	    - name: my-release-name
	      version: "my-release-version"
	    addons:
	    - name: some-addon-name
	      jobs:
	      - name: my-job-name
	        release: my-release-name
	        properties:
	          socket_endpoint: (( .properties.socket_endpoint ))
	      include:
	        jobs:
	        - name: credhub
	          release: credhub
	```
   For general information about writing the `tile.yml` file, see [Define your Tile in tile.yml](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-generator.html#define). For information about how to enable operators to use the tile to configure arbitrary properties in the manifest, see [Custom Forms and Properties](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-generator.html#custom-forms).

1. In the directory that contains the `tile.yml` file, run `tile build` to build the tile. The tile generator wraps the BOSH release of the KMS plugin into a tile, then places the tile file in the `product` subdirectory.

1. Navigate to Ops Manager, log in, and add the tile to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. For more information, see [Adding and Deleting Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/add-delete.html). 

1. Click the tile and complete the configuration.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** to complete the installation.
