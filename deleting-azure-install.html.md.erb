When you deploy [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) to Azure, you provision a set of resources. This topic describes how to delete the resources associated with a PCF deployment. 

The fastest way to remove resources is to delete the resource group, or resource groups, associated with your PCF on Azure installation.

## Delete the Resource Group

Perform the following steps to delete a resource group:

1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Within your subscription, select **Resource Groups**.

1. Click on the resource group you wish to delete.

1. In the details pane for the resource group, click on the trash can icon. Review the information in the confirmation screen before proceeding.

1. To confirm deletion, type in the resource group name and click **Delete**.

For more information about managing resource groups in Azure, see the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal).
