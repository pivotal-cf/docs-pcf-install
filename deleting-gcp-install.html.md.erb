When you deploy <%= vars.platform_name %> to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you provision a set of resources. This topic describes how to delete the resources associated with a <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.

  * If you created a separate project for your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment, perform the procedure in [Delete the Project](#delete-project).
  * If the project that contains your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment also contains other resources that you want to preserve, perform the procedure in the [Delete <%= vars.platform_name %> Resources](#delete-resources) section.
