<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) to v2.3. The upgrade procedure below describes upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager (Ops Manager), Pivotal Application Service (PAS), and product tiles.

For an up-to-date checklist of upgrade preparations, see [Upgrade Checklist for PCF v2.3](../upgrading/checklist.html).

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Changes:</strong> Read the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/index.html">Release Notes</a> and <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html">Breaking Changes</a> for this release, including the Known Issues sections, before starting the upgrade process.</p>

The apps in your deployment continue to run during the upgrade. However, you cannot write to your deployment or make changes to apps during the upgrade.

For details about how upgrading PCF impacts individual PCF components, see [PAS Component Behavior During Upgrade](../opsguide/single-component.html).


## <a id="beforeupgrade"></a> Before You Upgrade

This section contains important preparation steps, **Preps**, that you must follow before beginning an upgrade to Ops Manager v2.3. Failure to follow these instructions may jeopardize your existing deployment data and cause your upgrade to fail.

Pivotal recommends backing up your PCF deployment before upgrading, to restore in the case of failure. To do this, follow the instructions in the [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR](././backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

### <a id="groot"></a> Prep 1: Enable GrootFS

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If GrootFS is already enabled for your deployment, you can skip this step.</p>

You must enable GrootFS in your PAS v2.2 tile before upgrading to PAS v2.3. PAS v2.3 uses GrootFS as the only Garden image plugin and removes the checkbox to enable or disable GrootFS in the **Configure Application Containers** pane. For more information, see [Remove Deprecated Garden Image Plugin Option](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#groot) in the PAS v2.3 release notes.

To enable GrootFS, do the following:

1. Go to **Application Containers** in PAS.

1. Select **Enable the GrootFS container image plugin for Garden RunC**.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Go to **Director Config** in the BOSH Director tile.

1. Select **Recreate all VMs**.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**.

Once you have enabled GrootFS, ensure the apps running on your deployment
function properly before proceeding with your upgrade. Any issues you experience
are most likely to appear directly following the deployment of PAS.

### <a id='patch'></a> Prep 2: Install PAS v2.2.4 or Later

In PAS v2.3, traffic between the Gorouter and Cloud Controller is encrypted. To prevent app downtime while upgrading from v2.2 to v2.3, you must be running PAS v2.2.4 or later. These versions of PAS v2.2 contain the configuration `router.backends.enable_tls: true` in the Gorouter manifest.

### <a id="storage"></a> Prep 3: Review File Storage IOPS and Other Upgrade Limiting Factors

During the PCF upgrade process, a large quantity of data is moved around on disk.

To ensure a successful upgrade of PCF, verify that your underlying PAS file storage is performant enough to handle the upgrade. For more information about the configurations to evaluate, see [Upgrade Considerations for Selecting Pivotal Cloud Foundry Storage](../opsguide/storage_considerations.html).

In addition to file storage IOPS, consider additional existing deployment factors that can impact overall upgrade duration and performance:

|**Factor**|**Impact**|
|----------|----------|
|**Network latency**| Network latency can contribute to how long it takes to move app instance data to new containers. |
|**Number of ASGs**| A large number of [Application Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html) in your deployment can contribute to an increase in app instance container startup time. |
|**Number of app instances and application growth**| A large increase in the number of app instances and average droplet size since the initial deployment can increase the upgrade impact on your system. |

To review example upgrade-related performance measurements of an existing production Cloud Foundry deployment, see the [Pivotal Web Services Performance During Upgrade](../opsguide/pws_upgrade_load.html) topic.

### <a id="app_usage"></a> Prep 4: Verify App Usage Service Remedial Steps

If you upgrade from a PCF deployment that at one point included Elastic Runtime v1.7.16 or earlier, you must perform the remedial steps outlined in [App Usage Data and Events Data Become Corrupted After Upgrade or Install](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/App-Usage-Data-and-Events-Data-get-corrupted-after-upgrading-to-or-installing-Pivotal-Cloud-Foundry-17x) before proceeding with this upgrade.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you fail to perform the remedial steps for this issue, this upgrade process may corrupt your existing usage data.</p>

### <a id="cert-expiry"></a> Prep 5: Check Certificate Authority Expiration Dates

Depending on the requirements of your deployment, you may need to rotate your Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. The non-configurable certificates in your deployment expire every two years. You must regenerate and rotate them so that critical components do not face a complete outage.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> PCF uses SHA-2 certificates and hashes by default. You can convert existing SHA-1 hashes into SHA-2 hashes by rotating your Ops Manager certificates using the procedure described in the <a href="../security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html#rotate-saml-ca">Regenerating and Rotating Non-Configurable TLS/SSL Certificates</a> section of <em>Managing TLS Certificates</em>.</p>

To retrieve information about all the RSA and CA certificates for the BOSH Director and other products in your deployment, you can use the `GET /api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=TIME` request of the Ops Manager API.

In this request, the `expires_within` parameter is optional. Valid values for the parameter are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, and `y` for years. For example, to search for certificates expiring within one month, replace `TIME` with `1m`:

<pre class="terminal">$ curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=1m" \
 -X GET \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA_ACCESS_TOKEN"
</pre>

For information about regenerating and rotateing CA certificates, see [Managing TLS Certificates](../security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).

### <a id="download-targets"></a> Prep 6: Download Upgrade Versions

To minimize disruptions to your deployment during the upgrade, and to satisfy any simultaneous upgrade requirements, download the version of the product files you wish to upgrade from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).

At the minimum, you must download PAS v2.3.

### <a id="prepare-env"></a> Prep 7: Prepare Your Environment

1. Install the releases from your currently deployed version to the target version in sequential order. For example, if your deployment uses Ops Manager v1.11 and you are upgrading to v2.3, you must sequentially install v1.12, v2.0, v2.1, and v2.2 before proceeding with the upgrade to v2.3.

1. If you have disabled lifecycle errands for any installed product to reduce deployment time, Pivotal recommends that you re-enable these errands before upgrading. For more information, see the [Adding and Deleting Products](./add-delete.html#add-import) topic.

1. <%= partial 'check_disk_before_upgrade' %>

1. If not already disabled, disable the VM Resurrector:
   1. From your **Installation Dashboard**, select the **BOSH Director** tile.
    1. Click **Director Config**.
    1. Clear the **Enable VM resurrector plugin** checkbox.
    1. Click **Save**.
    1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard**.
    1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**.

1. If you disabled BOSH DNS, reenable it. In the **Director Config** pane of the **BOSH Director** tile, clear the **Disable BOSH DNS server for troubleshooting purposes** checkbox.

1. Check the required machine specifications for Ops Manager v2.3. These specifications are specific to your IaaS. If these specifications do not match your existing Ops Manager, modify the values of your Ops Manager VM instance. For example, if the boot disk of your existing Ops Manager is 50&nbsp;GB and the new Ops Manager requires 100&nbsp;GB, then increase the size of your Ops Manager boot disk to 100&nbsp;GB.

1. If you are upgrading a vSphere environment, ensure that you have the following information about your existing environment before starting the upgrade:
  * Record the following IP addresses, which you can find in the vSphere web client under **Manage** > **Settings** > **vApp Options**. This is the same information you entered at the end of deploying [Ops Manager on vSphere](./deploying-vm.html).
     * IP Address of the Ops Manager
     * Netmask
     * Default Gateway
     * DNS Servers
     * NTP Servers
  * Record the following VM hardware information so you can configure the new VM with similar settings. You can find this information in the vSphere web client under **Manage** > **Settings** > **VM Hardware**.
      * CPU
      * Memory
      * Hard Disk 1
      * Network Adapter 1. When you configure the new VM, ensure your network adapters are configured properly and are on the same network.

### <a id="stemcell-compat"></a> Prep 8: Check OS Compatibility of BOSH-Managed Add-Ons and Tiles

Some tiles released with PCF v2.3 require stemcells based on the Xenial OS rather than the older Trusty line. Before deploying tiles that use Xenial, you must:

- Update any BOSH add-ons used in your deployment so that they include both Trusty and Xenial stemcells. To do this, follow the [Update Manifests for BOSH-Managed Add-Ons](#add-on-manifest) directions below.
- For tiles that require Xenial, manually download and import a new Xenial stemcell into the <b>Ops Manager Stemcell Library</b>. See the [Tile Patch Releases Use Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html#xenial) note for details.

#### <a id="add-on-manifest"></a> Update Manifests for BOSH-Managed Add-Ons

Before upgrading to PCF v2.3, operators who have deployed any PCF add-ons such as **IPsec for PCF**, **ClamAV for PCF**, or **File Integrity Monitoring for PCF** and who have deployed or are planning to deploy [Pivotal Application Service for Windows](../windows/index.html) must modify the add-on manifest to specify a compatible OS stemcell.

For example, **File Integrity Monitor for PCF** (FIM) is not supported on Windows. Therefore, the manifest must use an `include` directive to specify the target OS stemcell of `ubuntu-trusty` and `ubuntu-xenial`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To upgrade to a Xenial stemcell, see the documentation for each add-on and follow the instructions.</p>

To update an add-on manifest, do the following:

1. Locate your existing add-on manifest file. For example, for FIM, locate the `fim.yml` you uploaded to the Ops Manager VM.

1. Modify the manifest to include following `include` directive to your manifest:

    ```yml
      include:
        stemcell:
          - os: ubuntu-trusty
          - os: ubuntu-xenial
    ```
1. Upload the modified manifest file to your PCF deployment. For example instructions, see [Create the FIM Manifest](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-fim/index.html#create-mfest).

If you use any other BOSH-managed add-ons in your deployment, you should verify OS compatibility for those component as well. For more information about configuring BOSH add-on manifests, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config.html#addons).

### <a id="check-health"></a> Prep 9: Check System Health Before Upgrade

1. Run `bosh <%= vars.bosh_cloud_check %>` to confirm that the VMs are healthy. For more information, see the [BOSH Cloudcheck](./trouble-advanced.html#cck) topic.

1. Check the system health of installed products. In the **Installation Dashboard**, select the **Status** tab for each service tile. Confirm that all jobs are healthy.

1. (Optional) Check the logs for errors before proceeding with the upgrade. For more information, see [Viewing Logs in the Command Line Interface](../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#view).

1. Confirm there are no outstanding changes in Ops Manager or any other tile. All tiles should be **green**. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** if necessary.

1. After applying changes, click **Recent Install Logs** to confirm that the changes completed cleanly:
    <pre>
    Cleanup complete
    {"type": "step\_finished", "id": "clean\_up\_bosh.cleaning\_up"}
    Exited with 0.
    </pre>

### <a id="azure-blobstore-addon"></a> Prep 10: Check External Blobstore Backup and Restore Add-On

If you have enabled external blobstore backups for an Azure Blobstore using the [Azure Backup Add-On](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/customizing/backup-restore/enabling-external-blobstore-backups.html#azure), you need to update your runtime configuration to remove the `sdk-preview` add-on before upgrading to PCF v2.3. If you do not remove this job, upgrading PAS fails with the error:

<pre>
Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment (00:00:01)
  L Error: Colocated job 'azure-blobstore-backup-restorer' is already added to the instance group 'backup-restore'.
</pre>

After removing this job from your runtime configuration, ensure that the **Enable backup and restore** checkbox is enabled in the PAS tile > **File Storage** pane. See [External Azure Storage](azure-er-config-terraform.html#external_azure) for instructions.


## <a id="upgrade_ops"></a> Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.3

### <a id="export"></a> Step 1: Export Your Installation

1. In your Ops Manager v2.2 **Installation Dashboard**, click the account dropdown and select **Settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/upgrade_to_1.9.png") %>

1. On the **Settings** screen, select **Export Installation Settings** from the left menu, then click **Export Installation Settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/export_install_settings.png") %>

This exports the current PCF installation with all of its assets.

When you export an installation, the export contains the base VM images, necessary packages, and configuration settings, but does not include releases between upgrades if Ops Manager has already uploaded them to BOSH. When backing up PCF, you must take this into account by backing up the BOSH blobstore that contains the uploaded releases. BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) backs up the BOSH blobstore. For more information, see [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR](./backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html).

* The export time depends on the size of the exported file.
* Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the export process and might appear to hang.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some operating systems automatically unzip the exported installation. If this occurs, create a ZIP file of the unzipped export. Do not start compressing at the "installation" folder level. Instead, start compressing at the level containing the <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>

<%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/compress.png") %>

### <a id="upgrade"></a> Step 2: Upgrade to Ops Manager v2.3

1. Download the Ops Manager VM Template v2.3 from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager) site.

1. Record the FQDN address of the existing Ops Manager VM.

1. To avoid conflicts, power off the existing Ops Manager VM.

1. Deploy the new Ops Manager VM by following the steps in one of these topics:
    * **AWS**: [Upgrading BOSH Director on AWS](./aws-om-upgrade.html)
    * **Azure**: [Upgrading BOSH Director on Azure](./azure-om-upgrade.html)
    * **GCP**: [Upgrading BOSH Director on GCP](./gcp-om-upgrade.html)

1. When redirected to the **Welcome to Ops Manager** page, select **Import Existing Installation**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/welcome.png") %>

1. When prompted, enter the **Decryption Passphrase** for this Ops Manager installation. You set this passphrase during your initial installation of Ops Manager.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If lost, the <strong>Decryption Passphrase</strong> cannot be recovered.</p>

1. Click **Choose File** and browse to the installation ZIP file exported in [Step 1](#export) above.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/decryption_passphrase.png") %>

1. Click **Import**.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the import process, and might appear to hang.</p>

1. A "Successfully imported installation" message appears upon completion.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/success.png") %>

### <a id="upgrade_products"></a> Step 3: Upgrade PAS and Product Tiles

1. <a name="success"></a> After upgrading to Ops Manager v2.3, upgrade your product versions.

1. Import the product file to your Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Hover over the product name in **Available Products** and click **Add**.

1. Click the newly added tile to review any configurable options.

1. (Optional) If you use other service tiles, you can upgrade them following the same procedure. See the [Upgrading PAS and Other Pivotal Cloud Foundry Products](./upgrading-products.html) topic for more information.

### <a id="perform-upgrade"></a> Step 4: Perform Your Upgrade

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> If the installation fails or returns errors, contact <%= vars.support_link %>. Do not attempt to roll back the upgrade by restarting the previous (v2.2) Ops Manager VM.</p>

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**. This immediately imports and applies upgrades to all tiles in a single transaction.
	<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> Only use **Apply Changes** to upgrade tiles immediately after upgrade. Do not use <strong>Review Pending Changes</strong> for selective deployment. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html#bosh-dns">Redeploy All Products After Upgrading to Ops Manager v2.2</a>.</p>

1. Click each service tile, select the **Status** tab, and confirm that all VMs
