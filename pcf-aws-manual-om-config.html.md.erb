This topic describes how to configure the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations
Manager components that you need to run <a
href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf">Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>
(PCF) on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

***<p class="tip">CAUTION: Pivotal strongly recommends installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry using AWS CloudFormation, as described in [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; on AWS](./cloudform.html), rather than configuring AWS manually as documented here.</p>***

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Ensure that you have successfully completed all steps in the [Manually
Configuring AWS for PCF](./pcf-aws-manual-config.html) topic before beginning
this procedure.

## <a id='pcfaws-om-access'></a>Step 1: Access Ops Manager ##

1. Locate the public DNS address address for Ops Manager on the **Instances**
    page of the AWS EC2 Dashboard.
    Sort the **Instance Type** column to find the **m3.large** instance that you
    created in [Configure the Pivotal Ops Manager
    AMI](./pcf-aws-manual-config.html#pcfaws-om-ami), then note the Public
    DNS for that instance.
    For example:

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/pcf_aws_public_dns.png") %>

1. Use the public DNS address of your Ops Manager instance to launch Ops Manager
    in a browser.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: On your first login attempt, an error
    message that the connection is untrusted appears because you are attempting
    to connect securely to a website with a self-signed certificate.
    Add Ops Manager as an exception to bypass this message on subsequent
    logins.</p>

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * <strong>[Use an Identity Provider](#idp)</strong>: If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * <strong>[Internal Authentication](#internal)</strong>: If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.


    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider ###

1. When redirected to the **Use an Identity Provider** page, you must:
    * Retrieve the metadata URL from your Identity Provider and copy it into the **Use an Identity Provider** area.
    * Create a passphrase. The passphrase you entered is a shared secret to encrypt Ops Manager data at rest.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

    <%= image_tag("meta-url.png") %>

1.  Your Identity Provider login page appears. Enter your username and password. Click **Login**.


### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1.  When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must:
    * Enter a **Username** and **Admin password**.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable if forgotten.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created on the initial setup page.

    <%= image_tag("cf-login.png") %>

1. Select **S3 Compatible Blobstore** for **Blobstore Location** and complete
    the associated fields:
    * **S3 Endpoint**: Navigate to the [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) topic in the AWS documentation. Locate the endpoint for your region in the **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** table and construct a URL using your region's endpoint. For example, if you are using the us-west-1 region the URL you create would be `https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com`. Enter this URL into the **S3 Endpoint** field in Ops Manager.
    * **Bucket Name**: Enter the Ops Manager bucket name that you defined in
    the [Create an S3 Bucket](./pcf-aws-manual-config.html#pcfaws-s3)
    section of the _Manually Configuring PCF for AWS_ topic.
    * **Access Key** and **Secret Key**: Enter your **Access Key ID** and **AWS
    Secret Key** information.
    To retrieve your AWS key information, use the IAM credentials that you
