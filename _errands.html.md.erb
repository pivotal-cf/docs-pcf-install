Errands are scripts that Ops Manager runs automatically when it installs or uninstalls a product, such as a new version of Pivotal Application Service (PAS). There are two types of errands: _post-deploy errands_ run after the product is installed, and _pre-delete errands_ run before the product in uninstalled.

By default, Ops Manager always runs pre-delete errands, and only runs post-deploy errands when the product has changed since the last time Ops Manager installed something. In PAS, the Smoke Test Errand defaults to always run.

The PAS tile **Errands** pane lets you change these run rules. For each errand, you can select **On** to run it always, **Off** to never run it, or **When Changed** to run it only when the product has changed since the last install.

For more information about how Ops Manager manages errands, see the [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](./managing_errands.html) topic.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Several errands, such as App Autoscaler and Notifications, deploy apps that provide services for your deployment. When one of these apps is running, selecting <strong>Off</strong> for the corresponding errand on a subsequent installation does not stop the app.</p>

* **Smoke Test Errand** verifies that your deployment can do the following:

    * Push, scale, and delete apps
    * Create and delete orgs and spaces

* **Usage Service Errand** deploys the Pivotal Usage Service application, which Apps Manager depends on.

* **Apps Manager Errand** deploys Apps Manager, a dashboard for managing apps, services, orgs, users, and spaces. Until you deploy Apps Manager, you must perform these functions through the cf CLI. After Apps Manager has been deployed, Pivotal recommends deselecting the checkbox for this errand on subsequent PAS deployments. For more information about Apps Manager, see the [Getting Started with the Apps Manager](../console/dev-console.html) topic.

* **Notifications Errand** deploys an API for sending email notifications to your PCF platform users.

    <p id='notifications' class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: 
        The Notifications app requires that you <a href='#smtp'>configure SMTP</a> with a username and password, even if you set the value of <strong>SMTP Authentication Mechanism</strong> to <code>none</code>.
    </p>
    
* **Notifications UI Errand** deploys a dashboard for users to manage notification subscriptions.

* **Pivotal Account Errand** deploys Pivotal Account, a dashboard that allows users to create and manage their accounts. In the Pivotal Account dashboard, users can launch applications, manage their profiles, manage account security, manage notifications, and manage approvals. See the [Enabling Pivotal Account](../opsguide/pivotal-account.html) topic for more information. 

* **App Autoscaler Errand** enables you to configure your apps to automatically scale in response to changes in their usage load. See the [Scaling an Application Using Autoscaler](../appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html) topic for more information.

* **NFS Broker Errand** enables you to use NFS Volume Services by installing the NFS Broker app in PAS. See the [Enabling NFS Volume Services](../opsguide/enable-vol-services.html) topic for more information.
