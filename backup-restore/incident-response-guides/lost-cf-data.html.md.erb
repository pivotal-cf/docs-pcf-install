title: Restoring Lost PAS Data
owner: Platform Recovery

This guide explains how to use BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) to restore a piece of
Pivotal Application Service (PAS) data, such as a user or space, which has been lost.

## <a id="prerequisite"></a>Prerequisite

Restoring PAS data with BBR is only possible if you have previously taken a backup
using the following command:

```
bbr deployment backup
```

This command produces a backup artifact in the format `PAS_DEPLOYMENT-TIMESTAMP/`.

## <a id="validating-artifact"></a>Validate Your Backup Artifact

Before restoring, verify that the backup artifact you have is suitable for your
restore need. You can `untar` and explore the PAS backup artifact to verify that
it contains the data that you need to restore.

Use any the checks in this section depending on the data you need to restore.

### <a id="verify-org"></a>Verify an Org Is Present

To verify that your backup artifact contains the org you need to restore, do the following:

```bash
tar -xvf backup_restore-0-bbr-cloudcontrollerdb.tar
cat cloudcontroller-artifact-file | grep "ORG-TO-RESTORE"
```
Where `ORG-TO-RESTORE` is the org you need to restore.

If you see the following line in the output of the above command, then
you can restore this org:

```
INSERT INTO `organizations` VALUES (..., ,'ORG-TO-RESTORE', ...);
``` 

### <a id="verify-space"></a>Verify a Space Is Present

To verify that your backup artifact contains the space you need to restore, do the following:

```bash
tar -xvf backup_restore-0-bbr-cloudcontrollerdb.tar
cat cloudcontroller-artifact-file | grep "SPACE-TO-RESTORE"
```
Where `SPACE-TO-RESTORE` is the space you need to restore.

If you see the following line in the output of the above command, then
you can restore this space:

```
INSERT INTO `spaces` VALUES (..., ,'SPACE-TO-RESTORE', ...);
```

### <a id="verify-user"></a>Verify a User Is Present

To verify that your backup artifact contains the user you need to restore, do the following:

```bash
tar -xvf backup_restore-0-bbr-uaadb.tar
cat uaadb-artifact-file | grep "USER-TO-RESTORE"
```
Where `USER-TO-RESTORE` is the user you need to restore.

If you see the following line in the output of the above command, then
you can restore this user:

```
INSERT INTO `users` VALUES (..., ,'USER-TO-RESTORE', ...);
```

### <a id="verify-route"></a>Verify a Route Is Present

To verify that your backup artifact contains the route you need to restore, do the following:

```bash
tar -xvf backup_restore-0-bbr-cloudcontrollerdb.tar
cat cloudcontroller-artifact-file | grep "ROUTE-TO-RESTORE"
```
Where `ROUTE-TO-RESTORE` is the route you need to restore.


If you see the following line in the output of the above command, then
you can restore this user:

```
INSERT INTO `routes` VALUES (..., ,'ROUTE-TO-RESTORE', ...);
```

### <a id="verify-domain"></a>Verify a Domain Is Present

To verify that your backup artifact contains the domain you need to restore, do the following:

```bash
tar -xvf backup_restore-0-bbr-cloudcontrollerdb.tar
cat cloudcontroller-artifact-file | grep "DOMAIN-TO-RESTORE"
```
Where `DOMAIN-TO-RESTORE` is the domain you need to restore.


If you see the following line in the output of the above command, then
you can restore this domain:

```
INSERT INTO `domains` VALUES (..., ,'DOMAIN-TO-RESTORE', ...);
```

### <a id="verify-app"></a>Verify an App Is Present

To verify that your backup artifact contains the app you need to restore, do the following:

```bash
tar -xvf backup_restore-0-bbr-cloudcontrollerdb.tar
cat cloudcontroller-artifact-file | grep "APP-TO-RESTORE"
```
Where `APP-TO-RESTORE` is the app you need to restore.

To verify that your blobstore backup artifact contains the droplet for the app
you need to restore, do the following:

```bash
tar -xvf blobstore-backup.tar
tree blobstore-backup | grep "APP-DROPLET"
```
Where `APP-DROPLET` is the droplet for the app you need to restore.

If you see the following line in the output of the above command, then you can
restore this app:

```
INSERT INTO `apps` VALUES (..., ,'APP-TO-RESTORE', 'APP-DROPLET', ...);
```

Where:

* `APP-TO-RESTORE` is the app you need to restore.
* `APP-DROPLET` is the droplet for the app that you need to restore.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you use an external blobstore, go to your IaaS console and check the backup bucket to verify that the droplet is present.</p>

## <a id="perform-restore"></a>Perform the Restore

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> BBR restore is a destructive process which removes any current data in your deployment. Performing a restore overwrites all new data since you created your most recent backup artifact.</p>

Pivotal recommends that you verify the compatibility of your backup artifact by
attempting the restore on an environment that is identical to the target
environment. If this is not possible, refer to the [Compatibility of Restore](../restore-pcf-bbr.html#compatibility) section of _Restoring PCF from Backup with BBR_ to confirm that your backup is compatible with your restore environment.

Run a PAS restore by following the BBR instructions in [Step 13: Restore PAS](../restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-ert) of _Restoring PCF from Backup with BBR_.

After a restore, PAS should roll back to its state at the time when the backup was taken, and contain the data that you had previously lost.

## <a id="consolidating-environment"></a>Consolidate Your Environment

If you have service instances that were not present when you performed the backup,
then the BOSH service deployments become orphaned. PAS has no reference to these
service deployments, but they continue to exist. You can locate orphaned service
deployments using the BOSH command-line interface (CLI).

You can locate orphaned on-demand service instances by running the
`orphan-deployments` errand. For more information, see [Orphan Deployments](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/management.html#orphan-deployments) in _Broker and Service Management_.
