Consider the following when backing up data in your <%= vars.first_product_name  %> deployment:

* If your deployment uses external databases, check that it is a <a href="backup-pcf-bbr.html#version-compatibility">supported database configuration</a>.

* If your <%= vars.product_name %> deployment uses internal databases, follow the backup and restore instructions for the MySQL server included in the [BBR](#bbr) documentation.

<strong><a id='gdpr'></a>General Data Protection Regulation</strong>

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect on May 25, 2018 and impacts any company processing the data of EU citizens or residents, even if the company is not EU-based.
The GDPR sets forth how companies should handle privacy issues, securely store data, and respond to security breaches.

Backup artifacts might contain personal data covered by GDPR. For example, a backup of a PAS could contain a user email. For further information regarding personal data that can be stored in <%= vars.product_name %>,
see the <a href="../../opsguide/gdpr.html">General Data Protection Regulation</a> topic.

## <a id='bbr'></a>Backup and Restore with BBR

BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) is a command-line tool for backing up and restoring BOSH deployments.

To perform a backup of your <%= vars.product_name %> deployment with BBR, see <a href="backup-pcf-bbr.html" class="subnav">Backing Up <%= vars.product_name %> with BBR</a>.

To restore your <%= vars.product_name %> deployment with BBR, see <a href="restore-pcf-bbr.html" class="subnav">Restoring <%= vars.product_name %> from Backup with BBR</a>.

To troubleshoot problems with BBR, see [Troubleshooting BBR](troubleshooting-bbr.html).

## <a id="restore-scenarios"></a>BBR Restore Scenarios

There are many different restore cases that can arise with BOSH Directors and <%= vars.product_name %> deployments. We have provided some guidance on how to use BBR in common restore scenarios below:

These guides do not cover all possible restore scenarios. If you encounter another restore case, then some information in these guides might be applicable.
