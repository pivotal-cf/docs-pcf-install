<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>
<html class="list-style-none"></html>

This guide describes the preparation steps required to install Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform templates. 

The Terraform template for PCF on AWS describes a set of AWS resources and properties.
For more information about how Terraform creates resources in AWS, see the
[AWS Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html) topic on the Terraform site. 

You may also find it helpful to review different deployment options in the
[Reference Architecture for Pivotal Cloud Foundry on AWS](../refarch/aws/aws_ref_arch.html).

## <a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites ##

In addition to fulfilling the prerequisites listed in the [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on AWS](./aws.html) topic, ensure you have the following: 

* The [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)
* In your AWS project, ensure you have an IAM user with the following permissions:
  * AmazonEC2FullAccess
  * AmazonRDSFullAccess
  * AmazonRoute53FullAccess
  * AmazonS3FullAccess
  * AmazonVPCFullAccess
  * IAMFullAccess

## <a id="download"></a>Step 1: Download and Edit the Terraform Variables File ##

Before you can run Terraform commands to create infrastructure resources, you must fill out a template variables file.

1. Navigate to the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) release on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io).

1. Download the AWS Terraform zip file.

1. Extract the contents of the zip file and place the folder in your `workspace` directory on your local machine.

1. From a terminal window, navigate to the folder:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cd ~/workspace/TERRAFORMING-AWS-FOLDER</pre>

1. Create a new file named `terraform.tfvars`.
  <pre class="terminal">$ touch terraform.tfvars</pre>

1. Open the `terraform.tfvars` file and paste in the following contents:

    ```
    env_name           = "YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME"
    access_key         = "YOUR-ACCESS-KEY"
    secret_key         = "YOUR-SECRET-KEY"
    region             = "YOUR-AWS-REGION"
    availability_zones = ["YOUR-AZ-1", "YOUR-AZ-2", "YOUR-AZ-3"]
    ops_manager_ami    = "YOUR-OPS-MAN-IMAGE-AMI"
    dns_suffix         = "YOUR-DNS-SUFFIX"

    ssl_cert = <<SSL_CERT
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    YOUR-CERTIFICATE
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    SSL_CERT

    ssl_private_key = <<SSL_KEY
    -----BEGIN EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY
    -----END EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    SSL_KEY

    ```

1. Edit the values in the file according to the table below:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 35%">Value to replace</th>
      <th>Guidance</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME</code></td>
      <td>Enter a name to use to identify resources in AWS. Terraform prepends the names of the resources it creates with this environment name. Example: <code>pcf</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>YOUR-ACCESS-KEY</code></td>
      <td>Enter your AWS Access Key ID of the AWS project in which you want Terraform to create resources.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>YOUR-SECRET-KEY</code></td>
      <td>Enter your AWS Secret Access Key of the AWS project in which you want Terraform to create resources.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>YOUR-AWS-REGION</code></td>
      <td>Enter the name of the AWS region in which you want Terraform to create resources. Example: <code>us-central1</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>YOUR-AZ-1<br>YOUR-AZ-2<br>YOUR-AZ-3</code></td>
      <td>Enter three availability zones from your region. Example: <code>us-central-1a</code>, <code>us-central-1b</code>, <code>us-central-1c</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>YOUR-OPS-MAN-IMAGE-AMI</code></td>
      <td>Enter the source code for the Ops Manager image you want to boot. You can find this code in the PDF included with the Ops Manager release on <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Network</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>YOUR-DNS-SUFFIX</code></td>
      <td>Enter a domain name to use as part of the system domain for your PCF deployment. Terraform creates DNS records in AWS using <code>YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME</code> and <code>YOUR-DNS-SUFFIX</code>. For example, if you enter <code>example.com</code> for your DNS suffix and have <code>pcf</code> as your environment name, Terraform will create DNS records at <code>pcf.example.com</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>YOUR-CERTIFICATE</code></td>
      <td>Enter a certificate to use for HTTP load balancing. For production environments, use a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA). For test environments, you can use a self-signed certificate. 

      Your certificate must specify your system domain as the common name. Your system domain is <code>YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME.YOUR-DNS-SUFFIX</code>.

      It also must include the following subdomains: <code>\*.sys.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN</code>, <code>\*.login.sys.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN</code>, <code>\*.uaa.sys.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN</code>, <code>\*.apps.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN</code>.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY</code></td>
      <td>Enter a private key for the certificate you entered.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

## <a id="download"></a>Step 2: Add Optional Variables ##

Complete this step if you want to do any of the following:

- Use an RDS for your deployment
- Deploy the Isolation Segment tile

In your `terraform.tfvars` file, specify the appropriate variables from the sections below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can see the configurable options by opening the <code>variables.tf</code> file and looking for variables with default values.</p>

### <a id="iso_seg"></a> Isolation Segments

If you plan to deploy the Isolation Segment tile, add the following variables to your `terraform.tfvars` file,
replacing `YOUR-CERTIFICATE` and `YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY` with a certificate and private key.
This causes terraform to create an additional HTTP load balancer across three availability zones to use for the Isolation Segment tile. 

```
create_isoseg_resources = 1

iso_seg_ssl_cert = <<ISO_SEG_SSL_CERT
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
YOUR-CERTIFICATE
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
ISO_SEG_SSL_CERT

iso_seg_ssl_cert_private_key = <<ISO_SEG_SSL_KEY
-----BEGIN EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY
-----END EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
ISO_SEG_SSL_KEY
```

### <a id="cloudsql"></a> RDS

1. If you want to use an RDS for Ops Manager and PAS, add the following to your `terraform.tfvars` file: 

    ```
    rds_instance_count = 1
    ```

1. If you want to specify a username for RDS authentication, add the following variable to your `terraform.tfvars` file.

    ```
    rds_db_username = username
    ```


## <a id="download"></a>Step 3: Create AWS Resources with Terraform ##

Follow these steps to use the Terraform CLI to create resources on AWS:

1. From the directory that contains the Terraform files, run `terraform init` to initialize the directory based on the information you specified in the `terraform.tfvars` file. 
  <pre class="terminal">$ terraform init</pre>

1. Run `terraform plan -out=plan` to create the execution plan for Terraform.
  <pre class="terminal">$ terraform plan -out=plan</pre>

1. Run `terraform apply plan` to execute the plan from the previous step. It may take several minutes for Terraform to create all the resources in AWS. 
  <pre class="terminal">$ terraform apply plan</pre>

## <a id="dns"></a>Step 5: Create DNS Record ##

1. In a browser, navigate to the DNS provider for the DNS suffix you entered in your `terraform.tfvars` file.

1. Create a new NS (Name server) record for your PCF system domain. Your system domain is `YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME.YOUR-DNS-SUFFIX`.

1. In this record, enter the name servers included in `env_dns_zone_name_servers` from your Terraform output.

## <a id="next"></a> What to Do Next ##

Proceed to the next step in the deployment, [Configuring BOSH Director on AWS (Terraform)](./aws-om-config-terraform.html).
