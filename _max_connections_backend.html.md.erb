(Optional) If you want to limit the number of app connections to the back end, enter a value in the **Maximum connections per back end** field. You can use this field to prevent a poorly behaving app from all the connections and impacting other apps. No value or a value of 0 sets no limit. <br/>
    To choose a value for this field, review the peak concurrent connections received by instances of the most popular apps in your deployment. You can determine the number of concurrent connections for an app from the `httpStartStop` event metrics emitted for each app request. <br/>    
    If your deployment uses <%= vars.product_name  %> Metrics, you can also obtain this peak concurrent connection information from the [Network Metrics](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-metrics/using.html#network) section of the _Monitoring and Troubleshooting Apps with <%= vars.product_name  %> Metrics_ topic. The default value is `500`.
