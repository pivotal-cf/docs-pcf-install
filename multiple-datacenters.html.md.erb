This topic describes how you can add, delete, and modify multiple vSphere vCenters in the **vCenter Configs** pane of the vSphere BOSH Director tile. This allows you to spread instances across regions without having to deploy and manage multiple PCF foundations. 

The ability to add and manage multiple vCenters was introduced in Ops Manager v2.2.

## <a id="add-vcenter"></a> Add a New vSphere vCenter

When you have only one vCenter, you do not see a list of vCenter configs when you select the **vCenter Configs** pane. Instead, you see the form to the one vCenter config and an option to **Add vCenter Config**.

To add a new vCenter, perform the following steps:

1. Click **Add vCenter Config** toward the top of the **vCenter Configs** pane.
  <%= image_tag("vcenters-buttons.png", :alt => "The 'Add vCenter Config' button is located to the right of the 'vCenter Config' header. The first field below is titled 'Name', indicated required with an asterisk. In the field, there is a unique name entered, 'first-vcenter'.") %>

1. Enter a unique **Name** for your vCenter to diffentiate it from your other vCenters.

1. Complete the rest of the form for your new vCenter. For more information about the fields, see _Step 2: vCenter Configs Page_ in [Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere](../om/vsphere/config.html#vcenter-config).

1. Click **Save**.

1. Select the **Create Availability Zones** pane. Create one or more AZs and associate them to your new vCenter with the **IaaS Configuration** field. For more information, see _Create Availability Zone Page_ in [Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere](../om/vsphere/config.html#create-az).

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id="modify-vcenter"></a> Modify a vSphere vCenter Config

To modify one of multiple vCenters, perform the following steps:

1. Go to the "List of vCenter Configs" by selecting the **vCenter Configs** pane or by clicking **View All Configs** from a vCenter config form.
  <%= image_tag("vcenters-list.png", :alt =>"The 'vCenter Config' pane a header called 'List of vCenter Configs' followed by the names of each vCenter next to a pencil icon. To the right of the main header is an 'Add vCenter Config' button." ) %>

1. Click the pencil icon to go to the form of that vCenter.

1. Edit the fields you want to change.

1. Click **Save**.
      
## <a id="delete-vcenter"></a> Delete a vSphere vCenter

To delete your vCenter, perform the following steps:

1. From the BOSH Director tile, select the **Create Availability Zones** pane.

1. Click the trashcan icon to disassociate each AZ with your vCenter. To know which AZs are associated with your vCenter, expand each AZ and see **IaaS Configuration**.<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager does not allow you to delete your first AZ or your first vCenter. Your first AZ is always associated with your first vCenter config.</p>

1. Click **Save**

1. Select the **vCenter Configs** pane. 

1. Click the trashcan icon to delete your vCenter.

1. Click **Save**.
