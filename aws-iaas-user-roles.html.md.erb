<%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you minimize the use of master account credentials by creating an IAM role and instance profile with the minimum required EC2, VPC, and EBS credentials.

Additionally, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you follow AWS account security best  practices such as disabling root keys, using multi-factor authentication on the  root account, and using CloudTrail for auditing API actions.
