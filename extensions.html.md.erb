<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic lists software add-ons that platform operators install to extend the capabilities of the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) platform.

Operators install add-ons in different ways. Some are tiles on [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io) that operators install via the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, just as they do with PCF services. Others add-ons are installed by creating a manifest and deploying it to BOSH with the `bosh <%= vars.bosh_upload_release %>` command.

Unlike PCF services, add-ons do not provide software services that developers can call from PCF apps.

## PCF Add-ons

* **[PAS for Windows 2012](https://docs-pas-windows.cfapps.io/pas-windows/index.html)** lets PAS host apps on Windows 2012 VMs and enables PCF developers to push .NET apps to these Windows cells.

* **[PCF Isolation Segment](../concepts/security.html#isolation-segments)** lets operators compartmentalize app hosting, routing, and logging resources into separate, dedicated resource pools.

* **[JMX Bridge](https://docs.pivotal.io/jmx-bridge/index.html)** collects and publishes data from PCF components to a Java Management Extensions (JMX) endpoint, to facilitate system monitoring and troubleshooting.

* **[PCF Healthwatch](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/)** helps operators understand the current health, performance, and capacity of a PCF platform.

* **[IPsec](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/index.html)** secures data transmissions inside PCF following IPsec standards.

* **[ClamAV](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-antivirus/1-3/index.html)** logs PCF internal antivirus protection activity, to demonstrate to auditors that it complies with industry standards and government regulations.

* **[File Integrity Monitoring](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-fim/index.html)** (FIM) logs PCF internal file integrity monitoring activity, to demonstrate to auditors that it complies with industry standards and government regulations.
