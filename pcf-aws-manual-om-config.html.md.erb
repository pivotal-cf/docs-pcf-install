    * For **Amazon Availability Zone**, enter the name of the AWS AZ that contains the
    private subnet CIDR (10.0.16.0/20) for your VPC, such as `us-east-1b`. Find the **Availability Zone** name on the **Summary** tab of the VPC Subnets page. For more information, refer to the [Configuring PCF for AWS](./pcf-aws-manual-config.html#pcfaws-vpc) topic.
    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/om_az_step4.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='pcfaws-om-networks'></a>Step 5: Create Networks Page ##
1. Select **Create Networks**.
<%= image_tag("cloudform/create-networks.png") %>
1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.
1. Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    * If you want to dynamically provision VMs in this network for use with on-demand services, select the **Service Networks** checkbox. When the checkbox is selected, Ops Manager does not provision VMs within the specified CIDR range.
    * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To use the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/index.html">Single Sign-On for PCF</a> service, you must configure a network with only one subnet.</p>
    * Enter your private subnet ID in **VPC Subnet ID**. This ID displays on the **Subnets** page of the **VPC Dashboard**.
    * For **CIDR**, enter `10.0.16.0/20`. Ops Manager will deploy VMs to this CIDR block.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can assign a single CIDR block to
    a VPC. The allowed block size is between a /28 netmask and /16 netmask.</p>
    * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, enter `10.0.16.1-10.0.16.9` to exclude Amazon IPs used at the bottom of the private range. Ops Manager will not deploy VMs to any address in this range.
    * Enter `10.0.0.2` for **DNS** and `10.0.16.1` for **Gateway**.
    * Select which **Availability Zones** to use with the network.
    * **(Optional)** If you are using a second subnet, click **Add Subnet**.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using multiple Availability Zones, you must add a new network with at least one subnet for each Availability Zone.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. A verification error displays because the PCF Security Group blocks ICMP. You can ignore this error.

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/network-error.png") %>

1. Select **Security**.

    <%= image_tag("../images/om-security.png") %>

1. In **Trusted Certificates**, enter a custom certificate authority (CA) certificate to insert into your organization's certificate trust chain. This feature enables all BOSH-deployed components in your deployment to trust a custom root certificate. If you want to use Docker Registries for running app instances in Docker containers, use this field to enter your certificate for your private Docker Registry. See the [Using Docker Registries](../opsguide/docker-registry.html) topic for more information.
1. Choose **Generate passwords** or **Use default BOSH password**. Pivotal recommends that you use the **Generate passwords** option for greater security.
1. Click **Save**. To view your saved Director password, click the **Credentials** tab.

## <a id='pcfaws-om-rscestem'></a>Step 8: Resource Config Page ##

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields,
choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the new recommended allocation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/resource-config-new.png") %>
