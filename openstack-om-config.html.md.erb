This topic describes how to configure the Ops Manager Director after deploying
[Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on OpenStack.
Use this topic when [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on OpenStack](./openstack.html).

Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all
steps in the [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html)
topic.
After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in [Deploying PAS on OpenStack](./openstack-er-config.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see the <a href="ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>


## <a id='log-in'></a> Step 1: Access Ops Manager

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For security, Ops Manager v1.7 and later require that you log in using a fully qualified domain name to access Ops Manager.</a></p>

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain you created in the [Create a DNS Entry](./openstack-setup.html#dns-entry) step of [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html).

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a> Use an Identity Provider

<%= partial 'using_idp_ops_manager' %>
