1. Select **Networking**.

1. Leave the **Router IPs**, **SSH Proxy IPs**, **HAProxy IPs**, and **TCP Router IPs** fields blank. You do not need to complete these fields when deploying PCF to AWS with Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs). 
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You specify load balancers in the <strong>Resource Config</strong> section of Elastic Runtime later in the installation process. See the <a href="#config-elb">Configure Router to Elastic Load Balancer</a> section of this topic for more information.</p>

1. Under **Configure the point-of-entry to this environment**, choose one of the following options:
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For details about the different SSL/TLS termination point options, how they correspond to different points-of-entry for Elastic Runtime, and related certificate requirements, see the <a href="../opsguide/security_config.html#ssl_term">Providing a Certificate for your SSL Termination Point</a> topic.</p> 
  * **Forward SSL to Elastic Runtime Router**: Select this option if your deployment uses an external load balancer that can forward encrypted traffic to the Elastic Runtime Router, or for a development environment that does not require load balancing. Complete the fields for the **Router SSL Termination Certificate and Private Key** and **Router SSL Ciphers**.
  <%= image_tag 'images/ert_lb_encrypted_certs.png' %>
  * **Forward unencrypted traffic to Elastic Runtime Router**: Select this option if your deployment uses an external load balancer that cannot forward encrypted traffic to the Elastic Runtime Router, or for a development environment that does not require load balancing.
  <%= image_tag 'images/ert_lb_unencrypted.png' %> 
  * **Forward SSL to HAProxy**: Select this option to use HAProxy as your first point of entry. Complete the fields for **SSL Certificate and Private Key**, and **HAProxy SSL Ciphers**. Select **Disable HTTP traffic to HAProxy** if you want the HAProxy to only allow HTTPS traffic. For more information, on configuring HAProxy, see <a href="../opsguide/ssl-term-haproxy.html">Configuring SSL/TLS Termination at HAProxy</a>.

   1. For AWS, you also need to specify the name of a TCP ELB in the **LOAD BALANCER** column of TCP Router job of the <b>Resource Config</b> screen. You configure this later on in Elastic Runtime. For more information, see the <a href="#config-elb">Configure Router to Elastic Load Balancer</a> topic.</p>
