This topic describes upgrading PCF from version 1.6 to 1.7. The upgrade procedures below describe upgrading Ops Manager, Elastic Runtime, and any product tiles that you have installed for which 1.7 versions are available. 
     
If you have already upgraded your Ops Manager to version 1.7 and want to upgrade
individual products such as Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Elastic Runtime, <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql">Pivotal MySQL</a>, or <a
href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service">RabbitMQ</a> in your PCF deployment, see the <a href="./upgrading-products.html">Upgrading
  Products in a PCF Deployment</a> topic.

<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING: </strong> Before you upgrade to Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.7, you must migrate all apps that are currently running on DEA architecture to run on Diego architecture. All apps that do not already run on Diego will terminate during an upgrade from 1.6 to 1.7.
</p>


**Important**: Read the Known Issues section of the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF)
[Release Notes](../pcf-release-notes/index.html) before getting started.

## <a id="beforeupgrade"></a>Before You Upgrade

This section contains important guidelines that you must follow before beginning an upgrade to PCF 1.7. Failure to follow these instructions may jeopardize your existing deployment data or cause your upgrade to fail.

The tasks you need to complete before upgrade fall into three categories: 

+ [Prepare Your Environment](#prepare-env) — includes making sure you have sufficient disk space.
+ [Prepare Databases and Apps](#prepare-db) — includes backing up data and migrating any apps 
that currently use the DEA architecture to use the Diego architecture.  
+ [Check System Health](#check-health) — perform a health check of your system, from virtual machines (VMs) to service tiles. 

### <a id="prepare-env"></a>Prepare Your Environment for Upgrade

1. To upgrade your Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;</a> (PCF) installation to a target release, you must install the major releases from your currently deployed 
version to the target version in sequential order. For example, if your deployment uses Ops Manager release 1.5 and you are upgrading to 1.7, 
you must sequentially install 1.6 and 1.7.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure that you are using Elastic Runtime (ERT) v. 1.6.9 or higher.</p>

2. Ensure that every product tile on the Installation Dashboard is compatible with the new version of Ops Manager. For specific compatibility information, refer to the full [Product Version  Matrix](../../compatibility-matrix.pdf).
If a product does not meet this requirement, you must upgrade the product or
remove the tile before upgrading Ops Manager.

3. For each product tile you have installed, review the upgrade documentation that is specific to the tile. For example, if you have RabbitMQ, you need to increase the number of HAproxy instances from one to two. See [RabbitMQ for Pivotal Cloud Foundry Upgrades](../../rabbitmq-cf/upgrade.html).

4. <%= partial 'check_disk_before_upgrade' %>

5. If you have disabled lifecycle errands  for any installed product in order to reduce deployment time, Pivotal recommends that you re-enable these errands before upgrading. See <a href="./add-delete.html#add-import">Adding and Deleting Products</a> for more  information.

6. Ensure that the VM resurrector is turned off:
   1. From your Installation Dashboard, select the **Ops Manager Director** tile. 
   2. Click **Director Config**.
   3. Clear the **Enable VM resurrector plugin** checkbox.

7. If you are upgrading a vSphere environment, ensure that you have the following information about your existing environment before starting the upgrade:
  * Note these IP addresses, which can be found in the vSphere web client, **Manage** > **Settings** > **vApp Options**.
    This is the same information you entered at the end of deploying [Ops Manager on vSphere](http://docs.pivotal.io/1.6/pivotalcf/customizing/deploying-vm.html). 
     * IP Address of the Ops Manager
     * Netmask
     * Default Gateway
     * DNS Servers
     * NTP Servers
  * Note down this VM hardware information so you can set up the new VM with similar settings. You can find this in the vSphere web 
client, **Manage** > **Settings** > **VM Hardware**.
     * CPU
     * Memory
     * Hard Disk 1
     * Network Adapter 1 - When you set up the new VM, ensure your network adapters are configured properly and are on the same network.

### <a id="prepare-db"></a>Prepare Databases and Apps for Upgrade


1. Back up all critical data prior to upgrading to PCF 1.7. Follow these instructions in the version 1.6 topic <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/1.6/pivotalcf/customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf.html">Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>. <br>
 

2. Before you upgrade to Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.7, you must migrate all apps that are currently running on DEA architecture to run on Diego architecture. Pivotal does not support DEA architecture in Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.7. See the [Migrating Apps to Diego](./apps-enable-diego.html) topic for information.


### <a id="check-health"></a>Check System Health Before Upgrade

5. Run `bosh cloudcheck` to confirm that the VMs are healthy.  See the [BOSH Cloudcheck](../customizing/trouble-advanced.html#cck) topic.

6. Check the system health of installed products. In the Installation Dashboard, select the **Status** tab for each service tile. Confirm that all jobs are healthy.

7. (Optional) Check the logs for errors before proceeding with the upgrade.
See the [Viewing Logs in the Command Line Interface](../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#view) topic.  

8. There should be no outstanding changes in Ops Manager or any other tile. All tiles should be green.
Click **Apply Changes** if necessary.

9. After applying changes, click **Recent Install Logs** to confirm that the changes completed cleanly:
    ```
    Cleanup complete
    {"type": "step\_finished", "id": "clean\_up\_bosh.cleaning\_up"}
    Exited with 0.
    ```


## <a id="keep"></a>Upgrading with Installed Products ##

Follow the steps below to upgrade Ops Manager and keep all installed products.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager 1.7 uses the User Account and Authentication (UAA), instead of only local user account authentication. When you import your pre-1.7 file to Ops Manager, your user name changes to <code>admin</code> and your password remains the same. It also prompts you to create a shared passphrase, which is distinct from your password. Your passphrase on a new import will be the same as your password. However, you must change the passphrase for security purposes. </p>

1. From the Product Dashboard, select **Actions > Export installation
settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/upgrade_to_1.7.png") %>

    This exports the current PCF installation with all of its assets.
    When you export an installation, the export contains the base VM images and
    necessary packages, and references to the installation IP addresses.
    As a result, an exported file can be very large, as much as 5 GB or more.
    * The export time depends on the size of the exported file.
    * Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the export
      process, and may appear to hang.
    * Some operating systems may automatically unzip the exported installation.
      If this occurs, create a zip file of the unzipped export.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When creating a zip file of an
      unzipped export, do not start compressing at the “installation” folder
      level.
      Instead, start compressing at the level containing the <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/compress.png") %>

2. Download the latest Ops Manager VM Template from the [Pivotal
Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) site.

1. Record the IP address of the existing Ops Manager VM.

1. To avoid IP conflicts, power off the existing Ops Manager VM.

1. Deploy the new Ops Manager VM:
    * [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on AWS](./cloudform-om-deploy.html)
    * [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html)
    * [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](./deploying-vm.html)
    * [Deploying Operations Manager to vCloud Air and vCloud](./pcf-vchs-vcloud.html)

1. When redirected to the **Welcome to Ops Manager** page, select **Import Existing Installation**. 

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/welcome.png") %>

1. When prompted, enter the following:
  * **Decryption Passphrase**, which is the same as your password. 
  * Click **Choose File** and browse to the installation zip file exported in Step 3 above.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/decryption_passphrase.png") %>

1. Click **Import**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: 
      Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the import process,
      and may appear to hang.</p>

1. Before you see the new PCF 1.7 **Installation Dashboard**, a Security Features alert appears. Take note of your new **username**. Ensure you change your decryption passphrase before sharing it with other users. Click **Continue**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/security_features.png") %>

1. A "Successfully imported installation" message appears upon completion.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/success.png") %>

1. Click **Apply Changes**. This immediately imports and applies upgrades to all tiles in a single transaction.

1. Click each service tile, select the **Status** tab, and confirm that all VMs appear and are in good health.

1. Remove the original Ops Manager VM from your IaaS if the new installation functions correctly.

## <a id="aftertheupgrade"></a>After the Upgrade

* Advise your application developers on targeting Diego when pushing their applications. See the [Migrating Apps to Diego](./apps-enable-diego.html) for more information.

* Ops Manager 1.7 defines specific instance types instead of custom sizes for vSphere or vCloud. Each instance adopts an instance type that is the closest match to its previous custom size for CPU, memory, and disk space. After the upgrade, you can modify the automatically selected instance size by selecting a different <code>type</code> under <strong>Resource Config</strong> for each of your installed tiles.

* (Optional) You can review your product tiles and configure values accordingly. For example, for Elastic Runtime, review the installation topic for new features:
     * [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on AWS](./cloudform-om-deploy.html)
     * [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html)
     * [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](./deploying-vm.html)
     * [Deploying Operations Manager to vCloud Air and
       vCloud](./pcf-vchs-vcloud.html)
