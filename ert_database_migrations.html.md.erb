title: Migrating MySQL databases in Elastic Runtime 
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

We do not yet have migration scripts written which will allow migration of Postgresql system databases (Cloud Controller, UAA, and Apps Manager) from the pre-1.6 Elastic Runtime deployments over to the internal MySQL cluster in Elastic Runtime. We currently expect to have these scripts completed sometime in the first half of 2016. Please refer back to this page for future updates.
