When you deploy [<%= vars.platform_name %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) to Amazon Web Services (AWS), you provision a set of resources. This topic describes how to delete the AWS resources associated with a <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment. You can use the AWS console to remove an installation of all components, but retain the objects in your bucket for a future deployment.
