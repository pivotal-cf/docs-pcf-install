This topic describes how to configure the Pivotal Elastic Runtime components
that you need to run [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) for VMware vSphere.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you plan to <a href = "http://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html">install the IPsec add-on</a>, you must do so before installing any other tiles. Pivotal recommends installing IPsec immediately after Ops Manager, and before installing the Elastic Runtime tile.</p>

## <a id='er-om-add'></a>Step 1: Add Elastic Runtime to Ops Manager ##

1. Navigate to the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) and click the **Pivotal Cloud Foundry** banner to access the PCF product page. Use the drop-down menu to select an Elastic Runtime release.

1. From the Available Products view, click **Import a Product**.

    <%= image_tag("guide/import-prod.png") %>

1. Select the Elastic Runtime `.pivotal` file that you downloaded from Pivotal
Network and click **Open**.
After the import completes, Elastic Runtime appears in the Available Products
view.

1. In the Available Products view, hover over Elastic Runtime and click **Add**.

    <%= image_tag("guide/add-products.png") %>

1. Click the Elastic Runtime tile in the Installation Dashboard.

    <%= image_tag("images/er-tile.png") %>

## <a id='er-az-networks'></a>Step 2: Assign Availability Zones and Networks ##

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**. These are the Availability Zones that you [create](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#create-az) when configuring Ops Manager Director.

1. **(vSphere Only)** Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**. Ops Manager runs any job with a single instance in this Availability Zone.

1. **(vSphere Only)**  Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**. Ops Manager balances instances of jobs with more than one instance across the Availability Zones that you specify.

1. From the **Network** drop-down box, choose the network on which you want to run Elastic Runtime.
<%= image_tag("er-az.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you save this form, a verification error displays because the PCF security group blocks ICMP. You can ignore this error.</p>
    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er-network-error.png") %>

## <a id='er-domain-config'></a>Step 3: Configure Domains ##

1. Select **Domains**.

    <%= image_tag("domains.png") %>

1. Enter the system and application domains.
    * The **System Domain** defines your target when you push apps to Elastic
      Runtime.
    * The **Apps Domain** defines where Elastic Runtime should serve your apps.

    <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Pivotal recommends that you use the same domain name but different subdomain names for your system and app domains. Doing so allows you to use a single wildcard certificate for the domain while preventing apps from creating routes that overlap with system routes. For example, name your system domain <code>system.EXAMPLE.com</code> and your apps domain <code>apps.EXAMPLE.com</code>.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id="networking"></a>Step 4: Configure Networking ##

1. Select **Networking**.

1. The values you enter in the **Router IPs** and **HAProxy IPs** fields depend on whether you are using HAProxy in your deployment. Use the table below to determine how to complete these fields.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose to assign specific IP addresses in either the <strong>Router IPs</strong> or <strong>HAProxy IPs</strong> field, ensure that these IP addresses are in the subnet that you configured for Elastic Runtime in Ops Manager.</p>

    <table border="1" class="nice" >
      <tr>
        <th><strong>Using HAProxy?</strong></th>
        <th><strong>Router IPs Field</strong></th>
        <th><strong>HAProxy IPs Field</strong></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>No</td>
        <td><ol>
        <li>Choose IP addresses from the subnet you configured in Ops Manager.</li>
        <li>Enter these IP addresses in the <b>Router IPs</b> field. You should specify more than one IP address for high availability.</li>
        <li>Configure your load balancer to forward requests for the domains that you have configured for your deployment to these IP addresses.</li>
        </ol></td>
        <td>Leave this field blank.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>Leave this field blank.</td>
        <td><ol>
        <li>Choose IP addresses from the subnet you configured in Ops Manager.</li>
        <li>Enter these IP addresses in the <b>HAProxy IPs</b> field. You should specify more than one IP address for high availability. </li>
        <li>Configure your load balancer to forward requests for the domains you have configured for your deployment to these IP addresses.</li>
        </ol>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. (Optional) In **SSH Proxy IPs**, add the IP address for your Diego Brain, which will accept requests to SSH into application containers on port `2222`.

1. (Optional) In **TCP Router IPs**, add the IP address(es) you would like assigned to the TCP Routers. You enable this feature at the bottom of this screen.

    <%= image_tag 'images/ert_networking_ip_fields.png' %>  
    
1. Under **Configure the point-of-entry to this environment**, choose one of the following options:
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For details about the different SSL/TLS termination point options, how they correspond to different points-of-entry for Elastic Runtime, and related certificate requirements, see the <a href="../opsguide/security_config.html#ssl_term">Providing a Certificate for your SSL Termination Point</a> topic.</p> 
  * **Forward SSL to Elastic Runtime Router**: Select this option if your deployment uses an external load balancer that can forward encrypted traffic to the Elastic Runtime Router, or for a development environment that does not require load balancing. Complete the fields for the **Router SSL Termination Certificate and Private Key** and **Router SSL Ciphers**.
  <%= image_tag 'images/ert_lb_encrypted_certs.png' %>
  * **Forward unencrypted traffic to Elastic Runtime Router**: Select this option if your deployment uses an external load balancer that cannot forward encrypted traffic to the Elastic Runtime Router, or for a development environment that does not require load balancing.
  <%= image_tag 'images/ert_lb_unencrypted.png' %> 
  * **Forward SSL to HAProxy**: Select this option to use HAProxy as your first point of entry. Complete the fields for **SSL Certificate and Private Key**, and **HAProxy SSL Ciphers**. Select **Disable HTTP traffic to HAProxy** if you want the HAProxy to only allow HTTPS traffic.

## <a id='er-auth-config'></a>Step 9: Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO ##

<%= partial 'authsso_config' %>

## <a id='er-db-config'></a>Step 10: Configure System Databases ##

You can configure Elastic Runtime to use the internal MySQL database provided with PCF, or you can configure an external database provider for the databases required by Elastic Runtime.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are performing an upgrade, do not modify your existing internal database configuration or you may lose data. You must migrate your existing data first before changing the configuration. Contact Pivotal Support for help. See <a href="upgrading-pcf.html">Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> for additional upgrade information.</p>

###<a id='internal-db'></a> Internal Database Configuration

<%= partial 'ert_database_internal' %>

Then proceed to [Step 10: (Optional) Configure Internal MySQL](#internal-mysql) to configure high availability and automatic backups for your internal MySQL databases.

###<a id='create-dbs'></a> External Database Configuration

<%= partial 'ert_database_external' %>

## <a id='internal-mysql'></a> Step 11: (Optional) Configure Internal MySQL ##

<%= partial 'mysql_proxy_config' %>

## <a id='filestore-config'></a>Step 12: Configure File Storage ##

For production-level PCF deployments on vSphere, the recommended selection is **External S3-Compatible** and the use of an external filestore. For more information about production-level PCF deployments on vSphere, see the [Reference Architecture for Pivotal Cloud Foundry on vSphere](../refarch/vsphere/vsphere_ref_arch.html).

For more factors to consider when selecting file storage, see <a href="../opsguide/storage_considerations.html">Considerations for Selecting File Storage in Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>. 

### <a id='internal_filestore'></a> Internal Filestore

<%= partial 'filestore_internal' %>

### <a id='external_s3'></a> External S3 or Ceph Filestore

<%= partial 'filestore_s3_config' %>

### <a id='other'></a> Other IaaS Storage Options

[Google Cloud Storage](./gcp-er-config.html#external_gcp) and [Azure Storage](./gcp-er-config.html#external_azure) are also available as file storage options but have not been evaluated for typical PCF on vSphere installations. 

## <a id='external-endpoints'></a>Step 13: (Optional) Configure System Logging ##

If you forward logging messages to an external Reliable Event Logging Protocol (RELP) server, complete the following steps:

1. Select the **System Logging** section that is located within your Pivotal Elastic Runtime **Settings** tab.
  <%= image_tag("updated-system-logging.png") %>
1. Enter the IP address of your syslog server in **Address**.
1. Enter the port of your syslog server in **Port**. The default port for a syslog server is `514`.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The host must be reachable from the Elastic Runtime network, accept TCP connections, and use the RELP protocol. Ensure your syslog server listens on external interfaces.</p>
1. Select a **Transport Protocol** to use when forwarding logs.
1. If you plan to use TLS encryption when sending logs to the remote server, select **Yes** when answering the **Encrypt syslog using TLS?** question.
  1. In the **Permitted Peer** field, enter either the name or SHA1 fingerprint of the remote peer.
  1. In the **TLS CA Certificate** field, enter the TLS CA Certificate for the remote server.
1. For the **Syslog Drain Buffer Size**, enter the number of messages the Doppler server can hold from Metron agents before the server starts to drop them. See the [Loggregator Guide for Cloud Foundry Operators](../loggregator/log-ops-guide.html) topic for more details.
1. If you want to include security events in your log stream, select the **Enable Cloud Controller security event logging** checkbox. This logs all API requests, including the endpoint, user, source IP address, and request result, in the Common Event Format (CEF).
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='customize-apps-man'></a>Step 14: (Optional) Customize Apps Manager##

<%= partial 'custombranding' %>

## <a id='smtp'></a>Step 15: (Optional) Configure Email Notifications ##

Elastic Runtime uses SMTP to send invitations and confirmations to Apps Manager
users.
You must complete the **Email Notifications** page if you want to enable end-user
self-registration.

1. Select **Email Notifications**.

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/smtp.png") %>

1. Enter your reply-to and SMTP email information

1. Verify your authentication requirements with your email administrator and use
the **SMTP Authentication Mechanism** drop-down menu to select `None`, `Plain`,
or `CRAMMD5`.
If you have no SMTP authentication requirements, select `None`.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not configure the SMTP settings using this form, the administrator must create orgs and users using the cf CLI tool. See <a href="../adminguide/cli-user-management.html">Creating and Managing Users with the cf CLI</a> for more information.</p>

## <a id='config-cc'></a>Step 16: Configure Cloud Controller##

<%= partial 'cloud-controller' %>

## <a id='config-smoke-test'></a>Step 17: Configure Smoke Tests ##

<%= partial '_smoketests' %>

## <a id='er-advanced'></a>Step 18: (Optional) Enable Advanced Features ##

<%= partial 'advanced-features' %>

## <a id='consul-cc'></a>Step 19: Disable Consul Locks

<%= partial 'consul-locks' %>

## <a id='er-errands'></a>Step 20: Configure Errands ##

<%= partial 'errands' %>

## <a id='resources'></a>Step 21: (Optional) Configure Resources ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager <%= vars.current_major_version %> defines specific instance types with preset sizes for CPU, memory, and disk space. Ops Manager 1.6 and earlier required custom sizes for these three resources. With the upgrade from 1.6 to 1.7, each instance adopts the type that most closely matches its previous sizes. To change these resource allocations, select a different instance <code>type</code> under <strong>Resource Config</strong>.</p>

Elastic Runtime defaults to a highly available resource configuration. However, you may still need to perform additional procedures to make your deployment highly available. See the [Zero Downtime Deployment and Scaling in CF](../concepts/high-availability.html) and the [Scaling Instances in Elastic Runtime](../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html) topics for more information.

If you do not want a highly available resource configuration, you must scale down your instances manually by navigating to the **Resource Config** section and using the drop-down menus under **Instances** for each job.

<%= image_tag("images/vcloud-vchs/resource_config-v.png") %>

By default, Elastic Runtime also uses an internal filestore and internal databases.
If you configure Elastic Runtime to use external resources, you can disable the
corresponding system-provided resources in Ops Manager to reduce costs and
administrative overhead.

Complete the following procedures to disable specific VMs in Ops Manager:

1. Click **Resource Config**.

1. If you configured Elastic Runtime to use an external S3-compatible filestore,
edit the following fields:
    * **File Storage**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.

1. If you selected **External** when configuring the UAA and System databases, edit the following fields:
    * **MySQL Proxy**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **MySQL Server**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **MySQL Monitor**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **Backup Prepare Node**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.

1. If you disabled TCP routing, enter `0` instances in the **TCP Router** field.

1. If you are using an External Load Balancer instead of HAProxy, enter `0` in the **Instances** field for **HAProxy**.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='stemcell'></a>Step 22: Configure Stemcell ##

1. Select **Stemcell**.
    This page displays the stemcell version that shipped with Ops Manager.
    <%= image_tag("stemcell.png") %>

	You can also use this page to import a new stemcell version. You only need to import a new Stemcell if your Ops Manager does not already have the Stemcell version required by Elastic Runtime.


## <a id='complete'></a>Step 23: Complete the Elastic Runtime Installation ##

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
Dashboard.

1. Click **Apply Changes**. If the following ICMP error message appears, click
**Ignore errors and start the install**.

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/install-error.png") %>

    The install process generally requires a minimum of 90 minutes to complete.
    The image shows the Changes Applied window that displays when the
    installation process successfully completes.

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/ops-manager-complete.png") %>
