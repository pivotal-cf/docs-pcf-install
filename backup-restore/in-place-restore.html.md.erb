title: Restoring an ERT Backup In-place

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This document describes how to run an _in-place_ restore of an Elastic Runtime (ERT) backup created with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR). An in-place restore differs from a normal restore in that you do not tear down and redeploy your environment before the restore. Instead, you restore the ERT backup to the same PCF environment that the backup was created from.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: An in-place restore erases any changes made to ERT since the backup was created. Follow the procedures in this topic only for sandbox or development environments, or when recovering from a disaster that affected ERT data.</p>

## <a id='scale-down-mysql'></a> Step 1: Scale Down MySQL

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, navigate to **Pivotal Elastic Runtime > Resource Config**.
1. Ensure the number of instances for MySQL Server is set to `1`.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: Restore fails if there is not exactly one MySQL Server instance deployed.</p>
1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to redeploy.

## <a id="retrieve"></a> Step 2: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials

Perform the following steps to retrieve the IP address of your BOSH Director and the credentials for logging in from the Ops Manager Director tile:

<%= partial 'bosh_target_director_bbr' %>

## <a id='identify-deployment'></a> Step 3: Identify Your Deployment

After logging in to your BOSH Director, run `bosh deployments` to identify the name of the BOSH deployment that contains PCF:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ bosh -e DIRECTOR_IP --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE deployments

Name                     Release(s)
cf-example               push-apps-manager-release/661.1.24
                         cf-backup-and-restore/0.0.1
                         binary-buildpack/1.0.11
                         capi/1.28.0
                         cf-autoscaling/91
                         cf-mysql/35
                         ...
</pre>

In the above example, the name of the BOSH deployment that contains PCF is `cf-example`. `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director. For more information, see [Ensure BOSH Director Certificate Availability](./system-setup-bbr.html#root-ca-cert).

## <a id='restore-ert'></a> Step 4: Restore Elastic Runtime

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If your apps must not be running after a restore run <code>bosh stop</code> on each <code>diego_cell</code> VM in the deployment.</p>

1. If you use an external blobstore and copied it during the backup, restore the external blobstore with your IAAS specific tools before running Elastic Runtime restore.

1. Run the BBR restore command from your jumpbox to restore Elastic Runtime:
<pre class="terminal">
$ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-PASSWORD \
      bbr deployment \
        --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
        --username BOSH-CLIENT \
        --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
        --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
        restore \
          --artifact-path PATH-TO-ERT-BACKUP
</pre>

    Replace the placeholder values as follows:
    <br><br>
    * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD`: Use the BOSH UAA user provided in  **Pivotal Ops Manager > Credentials > Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**.
    <br><br>
       You can also retrieve the credentials using the Ops Manager API with a GET request to the following endpoint: `/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/uaa_bbr_client_credentials`. For more information, see the [Using the Ops Manager API](../ops-man-api.html) topic.<br><br>
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP`: You retrieved this value in the [Step 2: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve) section.
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME`: You retrieved this value in the [Step 3: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment) section.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE`: This is the path to the BOSH Director's Certificate Authority (CA) certificate, if the certificate is not verifiable by the local machine's certificate chain.
    * `PATH-TO-ERT-BACKUP`: This is the path to the Elastic Runtime backup you want to restore.

    <p class="note validation">
      <strong>Validation</strong>: If you ran <code>bosh stop</code> on each <code>diego_cell</code> before running <code>bbr restore</code>, you can now run <code>cf stop</code> on all apps and then run <code>bosh start</code> on each <code>diego_cell</code>. After this, all apps will be deployed in a stopped state.
    </p>

1. Perform the following steps after restoring Elastic Runtime:
  1. Retrieve the MySQL admin credentials from CredHub using the Ops Manager API:
          1. Perform the procedures in the [Using the Ops Manager API](../ops-man-api.html) topic to authenticate and access the Ops Manager API.
          1. Use the `GET /api/v0/deployed/products` endpoint to retrieve a list of deployed products, replacing `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` with the access token recorded in the previous step:
              <pre class="terminal">$ curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/products" \
                -X GET \
                -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"</pre>
          1. In the response to the above request, locate the product with an `installation_name` starting with `cf-` and copy its `guid`.
          1. Run the following `curl` command, replacing `PRODUCT-GUID` with the value of `guid` from the previous step:
              <pre class="terminal">$ curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/products/PRODUCT-GUID/variables?name=mysql-admin-credentials" \
                -X GET \
                -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"</pre>
          1. Record the MySQL admin credentials from the response to the above request.
  1. List the VMs in your deployment:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    ssh</pre>
  1. Select the `mysql` VM to SSH into.
  1. From the `mysql` VM, run the following command:
    <pre class="terminal">$ sudo /var/vcap/packages/mariadb/bin/mysql -u root -p</pre> When prompted, enter the MySQL admin password.<br><br>
  1. At the MySQL prompt, run the following command:
    <pre class="terminal">mysql> use silk; drop table if exists subnets; drop table if exists gorp_migrations;</pre>
  1. Exit MySQL:
    <pre class="terminal">mysql> exit</pre>
  1. Exit the `mysql` VM:
    <pre class="terminal">$ exit</pre>
  1. List the VMs in your deployment:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    ssh</pre>
  1. SSH onto each `diego_database` VM and run the following command:
    <pre class="terminal">$ sudo monit restart silk-controller</pre>

      Restored apps will begin to start. The amount of time it takes for all apps to start depends on the number of app instances, the resources available to the underlying infrastructure, and the value of the **Max Inflight Container Starts** field in the Elastic Runtime tile.

1. If desired, scale the MySQL Server job back up to its previous number of instances by navigating to the **Resource Config** section of the Elastic Runtime tile. After scaling the job, return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to deploy.
