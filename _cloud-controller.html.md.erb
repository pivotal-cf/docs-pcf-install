1. **Cloud Foundry API rate limiting** prevents API consumers from overwhelming the platform API servers. Limits are imposed on a per-user or per-client basis and reset on an hourly interval. 
	<br><br>
	To disable Cloud Foundry API rate limiting, select **Disable** under **Cloud Foundry API rate limiting**. To enable Cloud Foundry API rate limiting:
	1. Under **Cloud Foundry API rate limiting**, select **Enable**.
	1. For **General limit**, enter the number of requests a user or client is allowed to make over an hour-long interval for all endpoints that do not have a custom limit. The default value is `2000`.
	1. For **Unauthenticated limit**, enter the number of requests an unauthenticated client is allowed to make over an hour-long interval. The default value is `100`.

1. (Optional) Enter in seconds your **Database connection validation timeout**. By default, the setting is `3600` seconds or 60 minutes. You can enter `-1` to cause Cloud Controller to make an additional query to the database whenever connections are checked out from the pool. Choosing `-1` has performance implications.
