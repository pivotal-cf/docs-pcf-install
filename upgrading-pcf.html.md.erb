<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) to v2.0. The upgrade procedure below describes upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager (Ops Manager), Pivotal Application Service (PAS), and product tiles.

The apps in your deployment continue to run during the upgrade. However, you cannot write to your deployment or make changes to apps during the upgrade.

**Important**: Read the [Release Notes](../pcf-release-notes/index.html) and [Breaking Changes](../pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html) for this release, including the Known Issues sections, before starting the upgrade process.

For more details about the impact of upgrading on individual PCF components, see the <a href="../opsguide/single-component.html" class="subnav">Understanding the Effects of Single Components on a Pivotal Cloud Foundry Upgrade</a> topic.

## <a id="beforeupgrade"></a>Before You Upgrade

This section contains important preparation steps, **Preps**, that you must follow before beginning an upgrade to Ops Manager v2.0. Failure to follow these instructions may jeopardize your existing deployment data and cause your upgrade to fail.

Pivotal recommends backing up your PCF deployment before upgrading, to restore in the case of failure. To do this, follow the instructions in the <a href="./backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html">Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR</a> topic. 

### <a id="storage"></a>Prep 1: Review File Storage IOPS and Other Upgrade Limiting Factors

During the PCF upgrade process, a large quantity of data is moved around on disk. 

To ensure a successful upgrade of PCF, verify that your underlying PAS file storage is performant enough to handle the upgrade. For more information about the configurations to evaluate, see <a href="../opsguide/storage_considerations.html" class="subnav">Upgrade Considerations for Selecting Pivotal Cloud Foundry Storage</a>.

In addition to file storage IOPS, consider additional existing deployment factors that can impact overall upgrade duration and performance:

|**Factor**|**Impact**|
|----------|----------|
|**Network latency** | Network latency can contribute to how long it takes to move app instance data to new containers. |
|**Number of ASGs**| A large number of [Application Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html) in your deployment can contribute to an increase in app instance container startup time.|
|**Number of app instances and application growth**| A large increase in the number of app instances and average droplet size since the initial deployment can increase the upgrade impact on your system. |

To review example upgrade-related performance measurements of an existing production Cloud Foundry deployment, see the <a href="../opsguide/pws_upgrade_load.html" class="subnav">Pivotal Web Services Performance During Upgrade</a> topic. 

### <a id="app_usage"></a>Prep 2: Verify App Usage Service Remedial Steps

If you are upgrading from a PCF deployment that at one point included Elastic Runtime v1.7.16 or earlier, you must perform the remedial steps outlined in <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/228639827-App-Usage-Data-and-Events-Data-Becomes-Corrupted-After-Upgrade-or-Install">App Usage Data and Events Data Become Corrupted After Upgrade or Install</a> before proceeding with this upgrade.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: If you fail to perform the remedial steps for this issue, this upgrade process may corrupt your existing usage data.</p>

### <a id="cert-expiry"></a>Prep 3: Check Certificate Authority Expiration Dates

Depending on the requirements of your deployment, you may need to rotate your Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. The non-configurable certificates in your deployment expire every two years. You must regenerate and rotate them so that critical components do not face a complete outage.

On the command line, run `GET /api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=TIME` to retrieve information about all the RSA and CA certificates for your deployment, including whether they are set to expire. Replace `TIME` with an integer and a letter code. Valid letter codes are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, and `y` for years.

For example, to search for certificates expiring within one month, replace `TIME` with `1m` as follows:

<pre class="terminal">$ GET /api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=1m</pre>

For information about how to regenerate and rotate CA certificates, see [Regenerating and Rotating Non-Configurable TLS/SSL Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).

### <a id="review-partners"></a>Prep 4: Review Partner Service Tiles

Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with PCF v2.0. Pivotal is working with partners to ensure their tiles are updated to work with the latest versions of PCF. For information about which partner service releases are currently compatible with PCF v2.0, review the appropriate partners services release documentation at [http://docs.pivotal.io](http://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner organization that produces the service tile.

### <a id="download-targets"></a>Prep 5: Download Upgrade Versions

To minimize disruptions to your deployment during the upgrade, and to satisfy any simultaneous upgrade requirements, download the version of the product files you wish to upgrade from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/). 

At the minimum, you must download PAS v2.0.x.

### <a id="prepare-env"></a>Prep 6: Prepare Your Environment

1. Install the releases from your currently deployed version to the target version in sequential order. For example, if your deployment uses Ops Manager v1.8 and you are upgrading to v2.0, you must sequentially install v1.9, v1.10, v1.11, and v1.12 before proceeding with the upgrade to v2.0.

1. If you have disabled lifecycle errands for any installed product to reduce deployment time, Pivotal recommends that you re-enable these errands before upgrading. For more information, see the <a href="./add-delete.html#add-import">Adding and Deleting Products</a> topic.

1. <%= partial 'check_disk_before_upgrade' %>

1. If not already disabled, disable the VM Resurrector:
   1. From your **Installation Dashboard**, select the **Ops Manager Director** tile. 
   2. Click **Director Config**.
   3. Clear the **Enable VM resurrector plugin** checkbox.
   4. Click **Save**.
   5. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** and click **Apply Changes**.

1. If your original PAS deployment was PCF 1.6 or earlier, rotate non-configurable Director certificates using the Ops Manager API. Follow Step 3 of the [Regenerating and Rotating Non-Configurable TLS/SSL Certificates](../security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html) topic to regenerate certificates, or begin with Step 1 to also update the certificate authority (CA).

1. Check the required machine specifications for Ops Manager v2.0. These specifications are specific [to your IaaS](gcp-om-deploy.html#start-vm). If these specifications do not match your existing Ops Manager, modify the values of your Ops Manager VM instance. For example, if the boot disk of your existing Ops Manager is 50 GB and the new Ops Manager requires 100 GB, then increase the size of your Ops Manager boot disk to 100 GB. 

1. If you are upgrading a vSphere environment, ensure that you have the following information about your existing environment before starting the upgrade:
  * Record the following IP addresses, which you can find in the vSphere web client under **Manage** > **Settings** > **vApp Options**. 
This is the same information you entered at the end of deploying [Ops Manager on vSphere](./deploying-vm.html). 
     * IP Address of the Ops Manager
     * Netmask
     * Default Gateway
     * DNS Servers
     * NTP Servers
  * Record the following VM hardware information so you can configure the new VM with similar settings. You can find this information in the vSphere web client under **Manage** > **Settings** > **VM Hardware**.
       * CPU
       * Memory
       * Hard Disk 1
       * Network Adapter 1. When you configure the new VM, ensure your network adapters are configured properly and are on the same network.

### <a id="upgrade-mysql"></a>Prep 7: Upgrade MySQL for PCF

If your PCF deployment includes both <strong><a href="../windows/index.html">PCF Runtime for Windows</a></strong> and <strong>MySQL for PCF v1.x</strong>, download and upgrade to MySQL for PCF v1.10.3 or later. For instructions on how to upgrade MySQL for PCF, see the 
 <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/index.html">MySQL for PCF</a> documentation.

### <a id="upgrade-rmq"></a>Prep 8: Upgrade and Configure RabbitMQ for PCF

If your PCF deployment contains **RabbitMQ for PCF**, download and upgrade RabbitMQ for PCF to v1.9 or later. For upgrade instructions, see the [RabbitMQ for PCF documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/1-10/index.html). As part of the upgrade, ensure that the firewall rules on your Rabbit VM instances allow inbound traffic on port `8301`.  

### <a id="upgrade-redis"></a>Prep 9: Upgrade and Configure Redis for PCF

If your PCF deployment contains **Redis for PCF**, download and upgrade to Redis for PCF v1.10. Ensure that you complete the following as part of the upgrade:
 
* When performing the upgrade, ensure that persistent disk is set to 3.5x the amount of RAM for your Dedicated-VM Redis instances. See [Networks, Security, and Assigning AZs](https://docs.pivotal.io/redis/1-10/installing.html#azs) for more information.
* Ensure you have configured [firewall rules](http://docs.pivotal.io/redis/1-10/odnetworking.html#network-rules) on your Redis VM instances.

For upgrade instructions, see the [Redis for PCF documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/redis/1-10/index.html).

### <a id="upgrade-add-ons"></a>Prep 10: Check OS Compatibility of PCF and BOSH-Managed Add-Ons

 Before upgrading to PCF v2.0, operators who have deployed any PCF add-ons (such as **ClamAV for PCF**, **IPsec for PCF**, or **File Integrity Monitoring for PCF**) and who have deployed or are planning to deploy [PCF Runtime for Windows](../windows/index.html) must modify the add-on manifest to specify a compatible OS stemcell. 

 For example, **ClamAV for PCF** is not supported on Windows. Therefore, the manifest must use an `include` directive to specify the target OS stemcell of `ubuntu-trusty`. 

 To update an add-on manifest, perform the following steps:

 1. Locate your existing add-on manifest file. For example, for ClamAV, locate the `clamav.yml` you uploaded to the Ops Manager VM.

 1. Modify the manifest to include following `include` directive to your manifest:

    ```yml
      include:
        stemcell:
          - os: ubuntu-trusty
    ```
 1. Re-upload the manifest file to your PCF deployment. For example instructions, see [Create the ClamAV Manifest](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-antivirus/index.html#create-mfest). 

 If you are using any other BOSH-managed add-ons in your deployment, you should verify OS compatibility for those component as well. For more information about configuring BOSH add-on manifests, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config.html#addons). 

### <a id="check-health"></a>Prep 11: Check System Health Before Upgrade

1. Run `bosh <%= vars.bosh_cloud_check %>` to confirm that the VMs are healthy. For more information, see the [BOSH Cloudcheck](./trouble-advanced.html#cck) topic.

1. Check the system health of installed products. In the **Installation Dashboard**, select the **Status** tab for each service tile. Confirm that all jobs are healthy.

1. (Optional) Check the logs for errors before proceeding with the upgrade.
For more information, see the [Viewing Logs in the Command Line Interface](../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#view) topic.  

1. Confirm there are no outstanding changes in Ops Manager or any other tile. All tiles should be **green**. Click **Apply Changes** if necessary. 

1. After applying changes, click **Recent Install Logs** to confirm that the changes completed cleanly:
    <pre>
    Cleanup complete
    {"type": "step\_finished", "id": "clean\_up\_bosh.cleaning\_up"}
    Exited with 0.
    </pre>

This exports the current PCF installation with all of its assets.<br/><br/>

When you export an installation, the export contains the base VM images and
necessary packages, and references to the installation IP addresses.
As a result, an exported file can be very large, 5 GB or more.

* The export time depends on the size of the exported file.
* Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the export
process and might appear to hang.<br/><br/>
    
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Some operating systems automatically unzip the exported installation. If this occurs, create a ZIP file of the unzipped export. Do not start compressing at the "installation" folder level. Instead, start compressing at the level containing the <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>

<%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/compress.png") %>

### <a id="upgrade"></a>Step 2: Upgrade to Ops Manager v2.0 ###
