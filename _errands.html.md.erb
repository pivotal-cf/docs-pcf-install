Errands are scripts that Ops Manager runs automatically when it installs or uninstalls a product, such as a new version of PAS. There are two types of errands: _post-deploy errands_ run after the product is installed, and _pre-delete errands_ run before the product in uninstalled.

By default, Ops Manager always runs all errands.

In the **Errands** pane, you can change these run rules. For each errand, you can select **On** to run it always or **Off** to never run it.

For more information about how Ops Manager manages errands, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](./managing_errands.html).

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Several errands, such as App Autoscaler and Notifications, deploy apps that provide services for your deployment. When one of these apps is running, selecting <strong>Off</strong> for the corresponding errand on a subsequent installation does not stop the app.</p>

* **Smoke Test Errand** verifies that your deployment can:

    * Push, scale, and delete apps
    * Create and delete orgs and spaces

* **Usage Service Errand** deploys the Pivotal Usage Service app, which Apps Manager depends on.

* **Apps Manager Errand** deploys Apps Manager, a dashboard for managing apps, services, orgs, users, and spaces. Until you deploy Apps Manager, you must perform these functions through the cf CLI. After Apps Manager has been deployed, Pivotal recommends setting this errand to **Off** for subsequent PAS deployments. For more information about Apps Manager, see [Getting Started with the Apps Manager](../console/dev-console.html).

* **Notifications Errand** deploys an API for sending email notifications to your PCF platform users.
    <p id='notifications' class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The Notifications app requires that you configure SMTP with a username and password, even if you set the value of <strong>SMTP Authentication Mechanism</strong> to <code>none</code>. To configure SMTP with a username and password, see <a href='#smtp'>Configure Email Notifications</a>.</p>

* **Notifications UI Errand** deploys a dashboard for users to manage notification subscriptions.

* **App Autoscaler Errand** pushes the App Autoscaler app, which enables you to configure your apps to automatically scale in response to changes in their usage load. For more information, see [Scaling an App Using Autoscaler](../appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html).

* **App Autoscaler Smoke Test Errand** runs smoke tests against App Autoscaler.

* **NFS Broker Errand** pushes the NFS Broker app, which supports NFS Volume Services for PAS. For more information, see [Enabling NFS Volume Services](../opsguide/enable-vol-services.html#nfs-enable).

* **Metric Registrar Smoke Test Errand** verifies the Metric Registrar can access custom metrics emitted by an app and convert them into Loggregator metrics.
	<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The Metric Registrar Smoke Test errand runs only if the Metric Registrar is enabled. For more information about configuring the Metric Registrar, see <a href ="../metric-registrar/index.html">Configuring the Metric Registrar</a>.</p>

* **SMB Broker Application Errand** pushes the SMB Broker app, which supports SMB Volume Services for PAS. For more information, see [Enabling SMB Volume Services](../opsguide/enable-vol-services.html#smb-enable).

* **Rotate CC Database Key** translates sensitive data in the Cloud Controller database to the currently specified **Primary** key. You specify this key in the **Encryption key ledger** field of the **Cloud Controller** pane.
