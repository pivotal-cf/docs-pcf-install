This topic describes how to configure the Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere.

Before you begin this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all steps in the [Deploying Ops Manager to vSphere](deploying-vm.html) topic. After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Deploying Elastic Runtime on vSphere](config-er-vmware.html) topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see the <a href="ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>


## <a id="set-up"></a> Step 1: Set Up Ops Manager

1. Navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager in a web browser.

1. The first time you start Ops Manager, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a> Use an Identity Provider

<%= partial 'using_idp_ops_manager' %> 

### <a id='internal'></a> Internal Authentication

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](./pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

    * **Template Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder (default: `pcf_templates`) where Ops Manager places VMs.
    * **Disk path Folder**: The vSphere datastore folder (default: `pcf_disk`) where Ops Manager creates attached disk images. You must not nest this folder.

    <%= image_tag("nsx-config.png") %>

1. Select a network configuration from one of the following:
    * **Standard vCenter Networking**: This is the default option when upgrading Ops Manager.
    * **NSX Networking**: Select this option to enable VMware NSX Network Virtualization. To configure NSX networking, enter the following information:
      * **NSX Address**: The address of the NSX manager.
      * **NSX Username**: The username to connect to the NSX manager.
      * **NSX Password**: The password for the username specified above.
      * **NSX CA Cert**: A CA certificate in PEM format that authenticates to the NSX server.
      If the NSX Manager generated a self-signed certificate, you can retrieve the CA certificate using OpenSSL with the following command: `openssl s_client -showcerts -connect NSX-MANAGER-ADDRESS:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509`
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To update NSX security group and load balancer information, see the <a href="update-nsx.html">Updating NSX Security Group and Load Balancer Information</a> topic.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After your initial deployment, you will not be able to edit the VM Folder, Template Folder, and Disk path Folder names.</p>


## <a id='dir-config'></a> Step 3: Director Config Page

1. Select **Director Config**.

    <%= image_tag("vsphere_director.png") %>

1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter your NTP server addresses.

1. (Optional) If you have installed and configured the [JMX Bridge](https://docs.pivotal.io/jmx-bridge/index.html) product, enter your **JMX Provider IP Address**.

1. (Optional) Enter your **Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address** if you are using the BOSH HM Forwarder.

1. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** to enable Ops Manager Resurrector functionality and increase Elastic Runtime availability. For more information, see the [Using Ops Manager Resurrector on VMware vSphere](./resurrector.html) topic.

1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** to run a post-deploy script after deployment. This script allows the job to execute additional commands against a deployment.

1. Select **Recreate all VMs** to force BOSH to recreate all VMs on the next deploy. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.

1. Select **Enable bosh deploy retries** if you want Ops Manager to retry failed BOSH operations up to five times.

1. Select **Keep Unreachable Director VMs** if you want to preserve Ops Manager Director VMs after a failed deployment for troubleshooting purposes.

    <%= image_tag("images/director_blobstore.png") %>

1. By default, PCF deploys and manages an **Internal** database for you. If you choose to use an **External MySQL Database**, complete the associated fields with information obtained from your external MySQL Database provider: **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, **Password**, and **Database**.

    <%= image_tag("images/director_database.png") %>

1. (Optional) **Director Workers** sets the number of workers available to execute Director tasks. This field defaults to `5`.

1. (Optional) **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the Ops Manager Director can run simultaneously. For vSphere, the default value is `32`. Leave the field blank to use this default value. Pivotal recommends that you use the default value unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.

1. (Optional) To add a custom URL for your Ops Manager Director, enter a valid hostname in **Director Hostname**. You can also use this field to configure a load balancer in front of your Ops Manager Director. For more information, see [How to Set Up a Load Balancer in Front of Ops Manager Director](https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/225420588) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base. 

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After your initial deployment, you cannot edit the Blobstore and Database locations.</p>


## <a id='create-az'></a> Step 4: Create Availability Zone Page

Ops Manager Availability Zones (AZs) correspond to your vCenter clusters and resource pools. Multiple Availability Zones allow you to provide high-availability and load balancing to your apps. When you run more than one instance of an app, Ops Manager balances those instances across all of the Availability Zones assigned to the app. Pivotal recommends using at least three availability zones for a highly available installation of Elastic Runtime.

1. Select **Create Availability Zones**.
    
    <%= image_tag("create-az.png") %>

1. Use the following steps to create one or more Availability Zones for your apps to use:
    * Click **Add**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the Availability Zone.
    * Enter the name of an existing vCenter **Cluster** to use as an Availability Zone.
    * **(Optional)** Enter the name of a **Resource Pool** in the vCenter cluster that you specified above. The jobs running in this Availability Zone share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For more information about using availability zones in vSphere, see the <a href="./understand-az.html">Understanding Availability Zones in VMware Installations</a> topic.</p>

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='create-networks'></a> Step 5: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.

    <%= image_tag("create-network.png") %>

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.

1. Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    *  If you want to dynamically provision VMs in this network for use with on-demand services, select the **Service Networks** checkbox. When the checkbox is selected, Ops Manager does not provision VMs within the specified CIDR range.
    * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network. 
    * Enter the full path and **vSphere Network Name** as it displays in vCenter. For example, enter `YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME/YOUR-NETWORK-NAME`. If your vSphere Network Name contains a forward slash character, replace the forward slash with the URL-encoded forward slash character `%2f`.
    * For **CIDR**, enter a valid CIDR block in which to deploy VMs. For example, enter `192.0.2.0/24`.
    * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **CIDR**
    that you want to blacklist from the installation. Ops Manager will not deploy VMs to any address in this range.
    * Enter your **DNS** and **Gateway** IP addresses.
    * Select which **Availability Zones** to use with the network.

1. Click **Save**.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Multiple networks allow you to place vCenter on a private network and the rest of your deployment on a public network. Isolating vCenter in this manner denies access to it from outside sources and reduces possible security vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using the Cisco Nexus
      1000v Switch, refer to the <a href="nexus-switch.html">Using the Cisco Nexus 1000v Switch with Ops Manager</a> topic for more information.</p>


## <a id='assign-azs'></a> Step 6: Assign AZs and Networks Page

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**.
<%= image_tag("assign-az.png") %>

1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Singleton Availability Zone**. The Ops Manager Director installs in this Availability Zone. 

1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Network** for your Ops Manager Director.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='security-config'></a> Step 7: Security Page

<%= partial "security-pane" %>

## <a id='syslog'></a> Step 8: Syslog Page

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> BOSH Director logs contain sensitive information that should be considered privileged. For example, these logs may contain cloud provider credentials. If you choose to forward logs to an external syslog endpoint, using TLS encryption is strongly recommended to prevent information from being intercepted by a third party.</p>

<%= partial 'syslog_bosh' %>


## <a id='resource-config'></a> Step 9: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.

    <%= image_tag("vsphere-om-resources.png") %>

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields, choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager v1.11 requires a Director VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='complete-installation'></a> Step 10: Complete the Ops Manager Director Installation

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Apply Changes** on the right navigation.
