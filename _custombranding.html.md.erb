The **Custom Branding** and **Apps Manager** sections customize the appearance and functionality of Apps Manager. Refer to the [Custom Branding Apps Manager](../opsguide/custom-branding.html) topic for more information.

1. Select **Custom Branding**.
	<%= image_tag 'custombranding.png' %>
	Use this section to configure the text, colors, and images of the interface that developers see when they log in, create an account, reset their password, or use Apps Manager.

1. Select **Apps Manager**. 
	<%= image_tag 'config-apps-man.png' %>
   Use this section to control access and role options for Apps Manager, as well as specify the headers and sidebar links that it displays.
   * Select **Enable Internal User Store** to use an internal user store in the 
PCF local UAA server. 
With the internal store enabled, PCF admins do not need to configure an external user store such as an LDAP / AD server. 
   * Select **Enable Non Admin Role Management** to allow Org managers and Space managers to assign roles to users in the Orgs and Spaces that they manage. 

    Both the **Enable Internal User Store** and the **Enable Non Admin Role Management** checkboxes must be selected if 
you want to invite new members to join an Org in Apps Manager. For more information about inviting users, 
see [Inviting New Users](../console/console-roles.html). Ensure that you select the **Push Apps Manager** 
post-deploy errand on the **Errands** tab so that these edits are applied to your Apps Manager installation. 
Follow the steps in the "Configure Errands" below.

1. Click **Save** to save your settings for each section.
