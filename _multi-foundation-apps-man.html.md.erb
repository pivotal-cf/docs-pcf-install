This section describes how to configure **Apps Manager** to display information from other foundations in addition to the
foundation it is installed on.

Given foundation A on which you want to configure Multi-Foundation Apps Manager, and
foundation B that you want to manage from foundation A's Apps Manager, follow these steps to
make foundation A able to connect to foundation B:

To configure multi-foundation support in Apps Manager, do the following: 

1. Select **Apps Manager** in one of your foundations. The following image shows the **Apps Manager** page.
    ![The Multi Foundation config section in the Apps Manager page has several fields](images/multi-foundation-apps-man-configuration.png)

1. For **Multi-foundation Configuration (BETA)**, enter a JSON object describing the foundations to connect to this foundation. Use data from those foundations' PAS configurations. For example:

    ```json
    {
      "FOUNDATION_NAME": {
        "ccUrl": "https://api.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com",
        "systemDomain": "FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com",
        "usageServiceUrl": "https://app-usage.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com",
        "invitationsServiceUrl": "https://p-invitations.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com",
        "logoutUrl": "https://login.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com/logout.do",
        "metricsUrl": "https://metrics.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com",
        "uaaUrl": "https://login.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com"
      },
    }
    ```
    Where:
    - `FOUNDATION_NAME` is the name of the foundation.
    - `FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN` is the system domain of the foundation.
    - `metricsUrl` is optional. Use this field if <%= vars.product_name  %> Metrics is installed on the foundation.

1. In UAA, the `apps_manager_js` client should have A's Apps Manager URL
(https://apps.a-foundation-system-domain.com) as a valid redirect URI. This is necessary so
that Apps Manager on Foundation A can redirect to B's UAA and back while
logging in. For more information about UAA clients and configuring valid redirect URIs, see
[Client.redirect-uri](../uaa/uaa-concepts.html#redirect-uri)

    To configure redirect URIs, use [the UAA CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac):
    1. Retrieve the UAA admin client credential for B as follows:
        1. Go to the PAS tile in OpsManager on Foundation B
        1. Go to the Credentials Tab
        1. Find the Admin Client Credentials under the UAA grouping
        1. Click on Link to Credentials
        1. Record the password field in the JSON response (ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET)
    1. Retrieve a token for the UAA admin client
        ```bash
        uaac target uaa.b-foundation-system-domain.com
        uaac token client get admin -s ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET
        ```
    1. Retrieve the currently set redirect uris from B's UAA apps_manager_js client and record
        the redirect-uris (PREVIOUS_REDIRECT_URIS)
        ```bash
        uaac client get apps_manager_js
        ```
    1. Update the apps_manager_js client with Foundation A's Apps Manager URL
        ```bash
        uaac client update apps_manager_js --redirect_uri \
            'PREVIOUS_REDIRECT_URIS,https://apps.a-foundation-system-domain.com/**'
        ```

1. If B is configured to use a certificate for TLS termination that is not signed by a
globally-trusted CA, you will need to add the root CA certificate that signed B's TLS
certificate as trusted by A's BOSH Director. This allows Apps Manager on foundation A to
validate the certificates used on B's endpoints (e.g. B's Cloud Controller). For more
information about setting the trusted certificates in BOSH, see [Setting Trusted
Certificates](../customizing/trusted-certificates.html)

1. (Optional) Pivotal recommends that you configure UAA on all foundations to use the same external SAML identity provider. This allows Apps Manager to
automatically log in with your identity provider on each foundation. To configure all foundations to use the same SAML identity provider, ensure all foundations use the same value in the PAS tile **UAA** page for **Provider Name**. 

For more information on UAA and identity providers, see [Identity Providers in
UAA](../uaa/identity-providers.html)

For more information on how to setup identity providers in UAA, see [Adding Existing SAML or
LDAP Users to a <%= vars.product_name  %> Deployment](../opsguide/external-user-management.html)
