title: Configuring a Shared VPC on GCP
owner: Ops Manager
---



This guide describes the preparation steps required to configure and integrate a shared Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with <%= vars.product_name  %>.

GCP Shared VPC, formerly known as Google Cross-Project Networking (XPN), enables you to assign GCP resources to individual projects within an organization but allows communication and shared services between projects.
For more information about shared VPCs, see [Shared VPC Overview](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/shared-vpc/) in the GCP documentation.


## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

To configure a shared VPC, you must assign your project to a Cloud Organization. Confirm that you have a Cloud Organization associated with your GCP account using one of the following methods:

  * **GCP Console**: From [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/), click the **Organization** dropdown at the top of the page to display
    all organizations you belong to.
  * **gcloud Command Line Interface (CLI)**: From the command line, run `gcloud organizations list` to display all organizations you belong to. See [gcloud Overview](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) in the Google documentation to install the gcloud CLI.

For more information, see [Creating and Managing Organizations](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id) in the GCP documentation. If you do not have a Cloud Organization, contact GCP support.


## <a id="provision"></a> Step 1: Provision the Shared VPC

Follow the [Enabling a shared VPC host project](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/shared-vpc/provisioning-shared-vpc#enable-shared-vpc-host) procedure in the GCP documentation.
This procedure requires shared VPC admin permissions.


## <a id="network"></a> Step 2: Create a Shared VPC Network

Use the procedures in the [Preparing to Deploy Ops Manager on GCP Manually](/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/om/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html) topic to create a new network with firewall rules. Do the following:

* [Step 3: Create a GCP Network with Subnet](/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/om/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#create_network)
* [Step 5: Create Firewall Rules for the Network](/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/om/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#firewall_rules)


## <a id="shared"></a> Step 3: Connect the Shared VPC to Pivotal Operations Manager

You can use the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) or the gcloud CLI to connect the shared VPC host project with Ops Manager.

For more information, see [VPC Network Peering](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/peering-networks) in the GCP documentation.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> VPC Network Peering is currently in beta and intended for evaluation and test purposes only.</p>

### <a id="shared-gui"></a> Set Up VPC Network Peering with GCP Console

To set up VPC network peering with the GCP console, do the following:

1. From the GCP console, click **Networking**, then **VPC network peering**.

    <%= image_tag("vpc-networks.png") %>

1. Click **Create Connection**.

1. Enter a name for the network connection from the Ops Manager project to the new shared network, such as `opsmanager-to-xpn`.

    <%= image_tag("om-to-vpc.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Create Connection**.

1. Enter a name for the network connection from the new shared network to the Ops Manager project, such as `xpn-to-opsmanager`.

    <%= image_tag("vpc-to-om.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="shared-cli"></a> Set Up VPC Network Peering with gcloud CLI

To set up VPC network peering with the gcloud CLI, do the following:

1. Enter the following command, replacing `OPSMANAGER-PROJECT` with the name of the project that contains your Ops Manager installation:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ gcloud config set project OPSMANAGER-PROJECT
    </pre>

1. Enter the following command to create a connection from the Ops Manager project to the new shared VPC project:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ gcloud beta compute networks peerings create OPSMANAGER-TO-VPC \
           --network OPSMANAGER-NETWORK \
           --peer-project VPC-HOST-PROJECT \
           --peer-network VPC-NETWORK \
           --auto-create-routes
    </pre>
    Replace the following text in the command above:
    * <code>OPSMANAGER-TO-VPC</code>: Choose a name for the connection, such as `om-to-vpc`.
    * <code>OPSMANAGER-NETWORK</code>: Enter the name of the network assigned to the Ops Manager project in GCP, such as `my-om-project`.
    * <code>VPC-HOST-PROJECT</code>: Enter the name you gave the shared VPC project in [Step 1: Provision the Shared VPC](#provision).
    * <code>VPC-NETWORK</code>: Enter the name of the network you gave the shared VPC project in [Step 2: Create Shared VPC Networks](#network).
    
1. Enter the following command, replacing `VPC-HOST-PROJECT` with the new shared VPC project you created in [Step 1: Provision the Shared VPC](#provision):
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ gcloud config set project VPC-HOST-PROJECT
    </pre>

1. Enter the following command to create a connection from the new shared VPC project to the Ops Manager project:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ gcloud beta compute networks peerings create VPC-TO-OPSMANAGER \
           --network VPC-NETWORK \
           --peer-project OPSMANAGER-PROJECT \
           --peer-network OPSMANAGER-NETWORK \
           --auto-create-routes
    </pre>
    Replace the following text and run the following command:
      * <code>VPC-TO-OPSMANAGER</code>: Choose a name for the connection, such as `vpc-to-om`.
      * <code>VPC-NETWORK</code>: Enter the name of the network you gave the shared VPC project in [Step 2: Create Shared VPC Networks](#network).
      * <code>OPSMANAGER-PROJECT</code>: Enter the name of the project that contains your Ops Manager installation.
      * <code>OPSMANAGER-NETWORK</code>: Enter the name of the network assigned to the Ops Manager project in GCP.


## <a id="verify"></a> Step 4: Verify the Shared VPC Configuration

After configuring a shared VPC, use the following procedure to verify that the shared VPC host project VM appears in the Ops Manager project.

1. From [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/), select the Ops Manager project from the drop-down menu at the top of the page.

1. Click **Networking**, then **VPC networks**.

    <%= image_tag("vpc-networks.png") %>

1. Confirm that the shared VPC network name appears in the **Subnets** list.

1. Confirm that the shared VPC network **IP address ranges** match what you set for the new VPC project in [Step 2: Create a Shared VPC Network](#network).
