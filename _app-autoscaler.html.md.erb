In the **App Autoscaler** pane, you configure the App Autoscaler service. To use App Autoscaler, you must create an instance of the service and bind it to an app. To create an instance of App Autoscaler and bind it to an app, see the [Set Up App Autoscaler](../appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html#setup) section in the _Scaling an Application Using App Autoscaler_ topic.

1. Click **App Autoscaler**. The following image shows the **App Autoscaler** pane.

    ![There is a heading at the top of the App Autoscaler page that says Configure App Autoscaler. There are several fields on the App Autoscaler page. The first three fields are Autoscaler Instance Count, Autoscaler API Instance Count, and Metric Collection Interval. There is a Save button at the bottom of the page](images/app-autoscaler.png)

1. For **Autoscaler instance count**, enter the number of instances of the App Autoscaler service you want to deploy. The default value is `3`. For high availability, set this number to `3` or higher. You should set the instance count to an odd number to avoid split-brain scenarios during leadership elections. Larger environments may require more instances than the default number.

1. For **Autoscaler API instance count**, enter the number of instances of the App Autoscaler API you want to deploy. The default value is `1`. Larger environments may require more instances than the default number.

1. For **Metric collection interval**, enter how many seconds of data collection you want App Autoscaler to evaluate when making scaling decisions. The minimum interval is 60 seconds, and the maximum interval is 3600 seconds. The default value is `120`. Increase this number if the metrics you use in your scaling rules are emitted less frequently than the existing metric collection interval.

1. For **Scaling interval**, enter in seconds how frequently App Autoscaler evaluates an app for scaling. The minimum interval is 15 seconds, and the maximum interval is 120 seconds. The default value is `35`.

1. To enable verbose logging for App Autoscaler, enable the **Verbose logging** checkbox. Verbose logging is disabled by default. Enable this checkbox to see more detailed logs. Verbose logs show specific reasons why App Autoscaler scaled the app, including information about minimum and maximum instance limits, App Autoscaler's status. For more information about App Autoscaler logs, see the [App Autoscaler Events and Notifications](../appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html#notifs) section of the _Scaling an App Using App Autoscaler_ topic.

1. If you do not want the Autoscaler API to reuse HTTP connections, enable the **Disable API connection pooling** checkbox. This may be necessary if your front end idle timeout for the Gorouter is set to a low value, such as 1 second. For more information, see [Configuring Front End Idle Timeout for Gorouter and HAProxy](frontend-idle-timeout.html).

1. To enable email notifications of Autoscaler events, enable the **Enable notifications** checkbox. For more information about managing email notifications, see the [App Autoscaler Events and Notifications](../appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html#notifs) section of the _Scaling an App Using App Autoscaler_ topic.
