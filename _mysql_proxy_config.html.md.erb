<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You only need to configure this section if you want to set up high availability for internal MySQL and have selected <strong>Internal Databases - MySQL</strong> in the <strong>Databases</strong> section.</p>

1. Select **Internal MySQL**.

1. For **MySQL Proxy IPs**, enter one or more IP addresses for your MySQL proxy instances. If a MySQL node fails, these proxies re-route connections to a healthy node. See the [MySQL for PCF: Proxy](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/index.html#proxy) topic for more information.</p>

1. For **MySQL Service Hostname**, enter an IP address or hostname for your load balancer. If a MySQL proxy fails, the load balancer re-routes connections to a healthy proxy. If you leave this field blank, components are configured with the IP address of the first proxy instance entered above.

1. Under **Automated Backups Configuration**, select **Disable mysql_backups** or **Enable mysql_backups** to enable or disable automated MySQL backups.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose to enable automated MySQL backups, set the number of instances for the **Backup Prepare Node** under the **Resource Config** section of the Elastic Runtime tile to `0`.</p>

1. If you select **Enable mysql_backups**, you need a Amazon Web Services (AWS) or <a href="http://ceph.com/">Ceph</a> S3-compatible blobstore. Configure your backup with the following steps:
	* For **S3 Bucket Name**, enter the name of your S3 bucket. Do not include a `s3://` prefix, a trailing `/`, or underscores. If the bucket does not already exist, it will be created automatically.
	* For **Bucket Path**, specify a folder within the bucket to hold your MySQL backups. Do not include a trailing `/`.
	* For **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS Secret Access Key**, enter your AWS or Ceph credentials.
	* For **Cron Schedule**, enter a valid cron expression to schedule your automated backups. Cron uses your machine's local time zone.

1. Click **Save**.
