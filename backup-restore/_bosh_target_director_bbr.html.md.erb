You access the BOSH Director using this IP address.

by running the following command: 

    <pre>
    bosh -e DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE log-in
    </pre>

    Where:
    * `DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP address recorded above.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate as outlined in [Step 1: Set Up your Jumpbox](#setup-jumpbox), above.
1. When prompted for **Email ()**, specify `director`.
1. When promted for **Password ()**, enter the **Director Credentials** that you obtained in 
   [Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).
 
    For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh -e 10.0.0.3 \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate log-in
    Email (): director
